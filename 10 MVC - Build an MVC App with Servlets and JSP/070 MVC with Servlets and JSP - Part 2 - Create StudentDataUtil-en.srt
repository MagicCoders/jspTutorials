1
00:00:00,673 --> 00:00:03,362
<v Teacher>Okay, so in our next step what we're</v>

2
00:00:03,362 --> 00:00:06,644
going to do is actually create the StudentDataUtil.

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:08,598
Remember, this is our helper class

4
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:11,848
that will allow us to access the model.

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,327
So, what I'll do here is I'll just move over

6
00:00:15,327 --> 00:00:18,744
to this package nvc2 and I'll right click

7
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:22,592
and I'm going to create a new class.

8
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:25,175
So right click, say new, class.

9
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:32,101
And for the class name we'll call it StudentDataUtil.

10
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:36,126
And I'll keep all the other defaults here

11
00:00:36,126 --> 00:00:40,043
and I'll go ahead and select the finish button.

12
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:45,204
Alright great, so this is my StudentDataUtil

13
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:47,245
and again, this is basically our model so

14
00:00:47,245 --> 00:00:51,121
this will basically return a list of student objects

15
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:53,615
when the servlet calls it, so this will actually

16
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:55,698
be called by the servlet.

17
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:07,433
I'll set up this method here, public static list student

18
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,243
get students, so the method is get students.

19
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:12,528
It's going to return a list of students.

20
00:01:12,528 --> 00:01:14,650
And I'll simply fix the imports here

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,213
for that list of objects from Java.Util.

22
00:01:18,213 --> 00:01:20,318
Okay, so here's my method, now let me go ahead and

23
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:22,192
just kind of write some comments here as for

24
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:25,817
what I need to do for the real coding here.

25
00:01:25,817 --> 00:01:28,179
So the first thing is creating an empty list.

26
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:31,284
The next thing is adding sample data.

27
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:35,077
And then I need to return that list to the calling program.

28
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:37,617
So that's the basic game plan here

29
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:42,107
for the implementation of this get students method.

30
00:01:42,107 --> 00:01:43,452
Alright, so let's write some code.

31
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:45,905
So the first thing you need to do is create and empty list.

32
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,863
So I'll create a list of students and

33
00:01:47,863 --> 00:01:51,222
I'll just say new array list and then

34
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,181
just open paren and closed paren.

35
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,648
And again, I need to go through and fix the

36
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:58,815
imports here so I can import that Java.Util.arraylist class.

37
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:04,394
Alright cool, so I have those two imports there at the top.

38
00:02:04,394 --> 00:02:07,574
Great, the next step here is adding sample data.

39
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:10,100
So I just make use of that array list students.

40
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,918
And I say students.add and now what I need to do is

41
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:15,513
actually create a new student object here.

42
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:17,143
So I need to use that constructor

43
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,346
that we created in the previous video.

44
00:02:19,346 --> 00:02:21,710
So I'll say new student and I'll just pass in

45
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,460
the values there for the student.

46
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:29,368
So the first student here is Mary Public and

47
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:32,705
her email address is mary@luv2code.com.

48
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:35,235
So that's our first student that we've added to the list.

49
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:37,314
Let me get some white space here.

50
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:38,827
And I'm just going to copy and paste

51
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:42,018
line 14 a couple of times for the other students.

52
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:44,268
So I'll just copy this line

53
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:48,253
and then I'll just paste it x number of times.

54
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:53,182
So I think I'll do it two more times, yeah that's good.

55
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:55,221
And I'll just change the first name and last name here

56
00:02:55,221 --> 00:02:57,804
for some of the other students.

57
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:00,997
So I have John Doe.

58
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:09,452
And then we also have Ajay Rao.

59
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,324
Alright, so that looks good right now.

60
00:03:16,324 --> 00:03:20,491
So we basically added three students here to our array list.

61
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:22,929
Good, so we have some data here right now.

62
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,846
So this is really good.

63
00:03:26,276 --> 00:03:27,905
Now what I want to do is simply return this list

64
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:30,640
to the calling program, so I simply use a return

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,983
and I give a reference to that array list and that's it.

66
00:03:33,983 --> 00:03:37,320
And I can save it and I think I'm in good shape here.

67
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,394
So again, this is simply our helper class, our model

68
00:03:41,394 --> 00:03:43,679
that will actually be called by our servlet.

69
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,998
So we simply create some student objects and

70
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:48,206
then we return that list of student objects

71
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:52,039
to the calling program, okay, good job so far.
