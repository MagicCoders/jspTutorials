1
00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:02,524
<v Instructor>Okay, great, so we have our</v>

2
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:04,443
StudenDataUtil created.

3
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:08,610
The next step is that we need to create our MVC Servlet.

4
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:16,450
So what I'll do is I'll simply right click,

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,283
I'll say New, Servlet.

6
00:00:21,512 --> 00:00:23,781
This will bring up the dialogue window here.

7
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:25,822
For the class name for our Servlet

8
00:00:25,822 --> 00:00:28,989
we're gonna call it MvcDemoServletTwo,

9
00:00:30,795 --> 00:00:35,057
so that's the name that we'll have here for it.

10
00:00:35,057 --> 00:00:36,298
And actually I have a typo here.

11
00:00:36,298 --> 00:00:39,465
Let me fix that typo to a lowercase W.

12
00:00:41,643 --> 00:00:44,552
Good, and now you can go ahead and hit the Finish button

13
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:46,885
once you're happy with that.

14
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:52,776
Okay, great.

15
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:53,818
So again, Eclipse does a lot of work.

16
00:00:53,818 --> 00:00:57,068
It creates a very basic Servlet for us.

17
00:00:58,005 --> 00:01:00,121
The first two lines here, 13 and 14,

18
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:04,647
it sets up our @WebServlet for MvcDemoServletTwo.

19
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,776
So, that's the basic, off-the-shelf stuff

20
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:09,137
that Eclipse will generate for us.

21
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,209
What I wanna focus on is this doGet method,

22
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,056
'cause that's where the requests

23
00:01:12,056 --> 00:01:14,367
are gonna come into, this doGet,

24
00:01:14,367 --> 00:01:16,239
so I'll just kinda clean up,

25
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:17,525
make some white space here,

26
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:19,812
give me some room to work with.

27
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:21,598
And what I'm going to do is actually,

28
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,315
inside of this doGet method is

29
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:25,705
remove that auto-generated code.

30
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:27,565
I wanna put my own code there,

31
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:31,739
so I'll simply highlight this and delete it.

32
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,533
And again, you know, I like to kinda go step-by-step

33
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,790
and I also like to start my comments here.

34
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,201
So, I'll just write some comments for us

35
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,091
for what I have to do.

36
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,122
So, the first thing I need to do

37
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:42,462
is get data from the helper class.

38
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:46,629
That's the StudentDataUtil that we created a little earlier.

39
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:50,808
And then the next thing I need to do is

40
00:01:50,808 --> 00:01:55,396
add this list of students to the request attribute,

41
00:01:55,396 --> 00:01:57,836
or the request object.

42
00:01:57,836 --> 00:02:00,493
Then the next thing I need to do is actually

43
00:02:00,493 --> 00:02:03,260
get the request dispatcher,

44
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,480
and once I have the request dispatcher,

45
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,647
then I can forward it to the appropriate JSP page.

46
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,559
So, those are the basic steps of what I need to do

47
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:18,476
in my Servlet code inside of this doGet method.

48
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:25,783
All right, so let me start writing some code.

49
00:02:25,783 --> 00:02:28,661
So, I'll get the list of students from that

50
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:32,860
StudentDataUtil, our model, or our helper class.

51
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,596
So, I'll simply say StudentDataUtil.getStudents,

52
00:02:36,596 --> 00:02:37,745
and that's the method that we created

53
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,212
in that previous video.

54
00:02:40,212 --> 00:02:41,236
And I need to go through and just

55
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:44,027
fix some of the imports here

56
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:45,860
for the JavaUtil.list.

57
00:02:51,777 --> 00:02:53,995
All right, so now I need to add the students

58
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:57,061
to the request object, so I'll simply set an attribute,

59
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,234
so I say request.setAttribute,

60
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:03,465
and I give the name, so I'll call it student_list,

61
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:05,817
that's the name, and then I give a reference to the object

62
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:07,864
from the previous line, students.

63
00:03:07,864 --> 00:03:10,364
So, give the name, the object.

64
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:14,587
Next, what I do is I get the request dispatcher.

65
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:16,920
So, I say RequestDispatcher,

66
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,452
dispatcher=request.getRequestDispatcher,

67
00:03:23,452 --> 00:03:26,869
and I simply give a path to the JSP page.

68
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:36,084
So, the page I'm gonna send that over to is

69
00:03:36,084 --> 00:03:37,917
view_students_two.jsp.

70
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,063
And again, go ahead and fix up some of the imports here

71
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:44,813
for the request dispatcher class.

72
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:52,367
All right, so that's my request dispatcher.

73
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,922
Now I need to actually forward the request

74
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:59,564
and response over, using this request dispatcher.

75
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:01,565
So here I say dispatcher.forward,

76
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,983
then I pass in the request response objects.

77
00:04:03,983 --> 00:04:06,844
And these objects were actually passed in as method params

78
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,011
up on line 31.

79
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,513
All right, so this looks good.

80
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,056
This is basically the code that we need to add

81
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:20,928
in our MVC Servlet to talk to our helper class model,

82
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,802
add the students to the request object,

83
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,909
get the request dispatcher, and then forward.

84
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:26,763
So, this is all really good,

85
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:30,197
and we built all of this code from scratch.

86
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:34,364
So, in the next video, we'll build out the JSP page.
