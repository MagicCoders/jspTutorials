1
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:02,206
<v Instructor>Alright, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,206 --> 00:00:03,128
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,176
And again we're gonna continue

4
00:00:04,176 --> 00:00:05,944
to use that same project servletdemo.

5
00:00:05,944 --> 00:00:09,010
The first thing we need to do here is we need to

6
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,177
add support for for our JSTL libraries to this project.

7
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,637
And effectively what we need to here is copy the JAR files

8
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:23,149
into this servletdemo project.

9
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:26,005
So what I'll do is I'll actually open up one of our previous

10
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,222
projects called tagdemo and I'll move into that web content

11
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:32,622
WEB-INF/lib directory. There's two JAR files here.

12
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:37,395
These are the two JAR files that I'll need for JSTL.

13
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:40,006
So let me go ahead and select those two JAR files,

14
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,339
right click and choose copy.

15
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:51,549
So I'm copying these JAR files from tag demo

16
00:00:51,549 --> 00:00:55,230
and I'm gonna move them up to my servletdemo project.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,260
So again we're adding JSTL support.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,997
So in servletdemo on the WEB-INF/lib,

19
00:00:59,997 --> 00:01:03,914
I'll just do a right click and I'll do a paste.

20
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:10,807
And this will basically paste it in those JAR files

21
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:13,424
to this servletdemo. So this looks really good.

22
00:01:13,424 --> 00:01:15,848
I should have two JAR files here listed.

23
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:19,786
So this is great. So now this project has JSTL support,

24
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:22,369
and we're good to go with this.

25
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:28,421
Alright, that took care of our housekeeping admin work

26
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,671
for servletdemo by adding JSTL support.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,395
Now let's go ahead and work on our

28
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,239
Mvc example.

29
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,293
So the first step we need to do is we need to actually

30
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:41,543
build a controller Servlet.

31
00:01:43,675 --> 00:01:45,604
So I'm moving to my Java resources directory.

32
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,666
Under source, I move down to my package servletdemo,

33
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:50,958
I'm gonna add a new Servlet here.

34
00:01:50,958 --> 00:01:55,125
So I'm gonna right click and I'll say new Servlet.

35
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,715
Alright, so this brings up our new Servlet screen.

36
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:04,016
What I wanna do is call this

37
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:06,947
Servlet class name MvcDemoServlet.

38
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:11,114
So that's the name that we're gonna use for this example.

39
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:13,289
Once I'm happy with the name,

40
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:15,872
I'll go ahead and click finish.

41
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:19,414
So again, Eclipse goes off, does a lot of work,

42
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:22,431
creating a nice Servlet for us to start with.

43
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:25,320
So this is very good. I love the way Eclipse helps us

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,237
jump start our development process.

45
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,595
Alright, so here's our Mvc Servlet with the annotation.

46
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:34,514
I'm gonna focus on the doGet method,

47
00:02:34,514 --> 00:02:39,449
so let me just clear out some space here at the bottom.

48
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,802
And, I'm gonna do all of my work inside of the doGet.

49
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:43,758
Now they have some auto generated code here,

50
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:45,329
I'm gonna actually remove that code,

51
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:47,246
and put in my own code.

52
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,005
We're gonna code this from scratch.

53
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:52,923
So again, I always like to set up my comments here.

54
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,094
So the set 0 is we're gonna add data.

55
00:02:56,094 --> 00:03:00,177
Step one, we're gonna get the request dispatcher.

56
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,316
And then, step two, we're gonna

57
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,634
forward the request to the JSP.

58
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:10,128
So those are the three main steps

59
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:11,925
that we're gonna accomplish here

60
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:15,092
in this doGet method for our Mvc demo.

61
00:03:18,726 --> 00:03:20,077
So first off, adding some data.

62
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:23,097
So I'm just gonna make up some data here.

63
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:26,722
Students, and I give a four student names.

64
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:28,608
We could retrieve this from a database

65
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,157
or we could possibly retrieve this

66
00:03:30,157 --> 00:03:31,471
from a backend helper object.

67
00:03:31,471 --> 00:03:33,545
But just for keeping it simple right now,

68
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,247
I'll just define the data right here in this Servlet.

69
00:03:36,247 --> 00:03:40,414
We'll get into more advance examples later on in the course.

70
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,152
And then I have the students object,

71
00:03:46,152 --> 00:03:48,883
so now I set attributes. So I give the attribute name.

72
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:51,088
I'll call it student_,list,

73
00:03:51,088 --> 00:03:53,028
and then I give a reference to that object

74
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:55,540
that I just created in the previous line here students.

75
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,192
So that's basically it.

76
00:03:57,192 --> 00:04:00,654
So we've created some data, and we've added this data

77
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:01,629
to the request object

78
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:04,709
by making use of request set attribute.

79
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,614
And again, we can set as many attributes as we'd like here

80
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:12,447
as long as they have unique names.

81
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:15,961
Alright, so the next thing I need to do is set up

82
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,790
a request dispatcher. So remember the request dispatcher

83
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,345
is what we can use to actually make a call to the JSP page.

84
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:25,732
So I say get request dispatcher

85
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,572
and I give the actual name

86
00:04:27,572 --> 00:04:30,072
of the JSP, view_students.jsp.

87
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,852
And, I'll go here to line 35 and I'll fix some of the

88
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:37,769
imports here for this request dispatcher class.

89
00:04:40,065 --> 00:04:40,898
And I'll select that option,

90
00:04:40,898 --> 00:04:42,404
that should clear up the imports there.

91
00:04:42,404 --> 00:04:45,177
Okay great, so I have the request dispatcher

92
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:47,573
for that view_students.jsp.

93
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,596
Now step two is very important,

94
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:50,998
I have to complete this step.

95
00:04:50,998 --> 00:04:54,029
I have to explicitly forward the request

96
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:54,862
over to

97
00:04:56,586 --> 00:04:57,419
that JSP.

98
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,169
So here I say dispatcher.forward,

99
00:05:01,624 --> 00:05:03,844
and I'll forward over the request and the response option.

100
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,275
So those are the two parameters

101
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,980
that came into this method here,

102
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,220
that we've added some data to the request,

103
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,463
and then we're forwarding that data

104
00:05:11,463 --> 00:05:14,660
all across to that actual JSP.

105
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,712
And that JSP can read the data at a later time.

106
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,355
But that's the main code here for

107
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:21,188
forwarding the request to the JSP.

108
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:24,294
Alright, so just kinda stepping back here just looking

109
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:26,216
at the method that we've created all from scratch.

110
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:28,576
Step zero we added the student data,

111
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:30,981
step one we got the request dispatcher,

112
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:34,915
and then step two we forwarded the request to the JSP.

113
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:38,978
So this is the main work for our Servlet controller,

114
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:40,561
in our Mvc example.

115
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:42,659
Good job.

116
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:49,588
Alright, so the next thing we need to do in our Mvc example

117
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:51,573
is that we need to add the JSP page,

118
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:53,029
that view_students.jsp.

119
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:54,815
We need to actually create that file.

120
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,710
So my web content directory, I'll right click.

121
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,210
I'll say new file.

122
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:02,872
And I'll have to use the exact same file name

123
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:05,944
that my JSP is gonna forward to.

124
00:06:05,944 --> 00:06:10,027
So, there gonna foreword it to view_students.jsp.

125
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:12,696
So you have to make sure those names

126
00:06:12,696 --> 00:06:15,190
are the same and correct.

127
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,170
And once you're happy with this name,

128
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:18,337
go ahead and click finish.

129
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:24,031
So let me expand this window here.

130
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,943
One thing this JSP page is gonna make use of JSTL.

131
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:28,327
So we always have to give our JSTL

132
00:06:28,327 --> 00:06:29,875
taglib reference at the top.

133
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,167
Then I have a little cheat sheet that I like to copy

134
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,696
paste cause I, you know, I don't wanna get it wrong.

135
00:06:34,696 --> 00:06:36,567
So I like to do it the correct way every time.

136
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,384
So anyway, that's the taglib reference.

137
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:41,492
Let me go ahead and do some html housekeeping here

138
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:44,575
with our html tags and our body tags.

139
00:06:45,774 --> 00:06:47,709
Now, what I'd like to do is actually do a loop.

140
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,172
And I wanna loop over that

141
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:51,653
student list data that was passed in.

142
00:06:51,653 --> 00:06:53,903
So I set up this c:forEach,

143
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:58,939
and I set the variable, I call it temp student.

144
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:02,118
And then items, this is the actual name of that attribute

145
00:07:02,118 --> 00:07:03,526
that was set by the Servlets.

146
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:04,642
So here I say

147
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:05,475
${

148
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,052
student_list,

149
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,965
so again this is the exact same attribute name

150
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,832
that was set by the Servlet.

151
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,939
And we have to use the exact same name

152
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:17,306
in order for the JSP to find it.

153
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:21,473
So that's like the label or the alias for that data.

154
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:28,868
So we have that set up. Now I can actually display

155
00:07:28,868 --> 00:07:31,915
that tempStudent here. So I use ${tempstudent

156
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:34,744
and I just add a little br for a line break,

157
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:36,744
and that's basically it.

158
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,512
So this four loop here will basically loop through that

159
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:45,735
student list and it'll display

160
00:07:45,735 --> 00:07:48,583
the actual student information,

161
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,720
or the temp student as it goes through the list.

162
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,301
So this is really good, I'm excited about this.

163
00:07:52,301 --> 00:07:54,530
I'm ready to try it out [Laughs].

164
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,501
Alright so, in order to test this one here

165
00:07:56,501 --> 00:07:58,945
we need to go and run our Mvc Servlet.

166
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,416
So I select my Mvc demoservlet,

167
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,249
I'll do a right click,

168
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:06,437
and I'll choose run as,

169
00:08:06,437 --> 00:08:08,354
and then run on server.

170
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,181
And, woohoo, this looks really good.

171
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:19,009
So, this is the result of our Mvc example.

172
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:21,579
Our Mvc Servlet went off and

173
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:23,507
added some data to that request.

174
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:27,674
It sent it to our JSP and our JSP went through and displayed

175
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:29,678
each one of those student names.

176
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:32,896
So their all working together.

177
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:35,654
This is awesome, I like it.

178
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:37,739
So this is a good way to kinda wrap this up.

179
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:39,695
So we built an Mvc system from scratch,

180
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:41,643
very simple one, but we built it from scratch.

181
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:43,715
We created a controller Servlet,

182
00:08:43,715 --> 00:08:46,495
and we also created a view JSP,

183
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:50,078
and we integrated Servlets and JSP together

184
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,395
for an Mvc system.

185
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:54,312
Great job.
