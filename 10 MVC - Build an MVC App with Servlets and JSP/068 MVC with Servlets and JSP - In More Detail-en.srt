00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:03,333
<v Instructor>Hey, in this video we're going</v>

2
00:00:03,333 --> 00:00:06,020
to cover MVC with servlets and JSP

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,706
and I'll actually go into more detail

4
00:00:07,706 --> 00:00:10,623
than we did in the previous videos.

5
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:15,641
So in the previous video we had an overview of MVC, right,

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,930
so the first thing is that,

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,673
the request comes into the controllers servlet,

8
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:22,710
we make use of the model and then we have the view,

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,375
and then I'd sent it back to the web browser.

10
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,593
However, in the previous videos we didn't really get

11
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:30,878
into the details of step two as far as using the model.

12
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:32,265
So that's what we'll do in this video.

13
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,153
We'll actually create a helper class,

14
00:00:34,153 --> 00:00:37,848
called StudentDataUtil.java and it's going to be our model.

15
00:00:37,848 --> 00:00:41,291
It's basically going to give us a list of students,

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,410
so basically, for step two,

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,650
our controller servlet will make a call

18
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,881
to the student data util, get a list of students

19
00:00:48,881 --> 00:00:51,663
and then it will put them into that request attribute,

20
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:53,240
send it over to the view

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,966
and then the view will generate a view page

22
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:58,871
that it'll send back to the browser.

23
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:01,164
So, this view page that the JSP sends back,

24
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:03,033
we're going to enhance it a little bit.

25
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:06,335
In the previous videos we simply made use of a list,

26
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:08,536
here we're actually going to make use of a table.

27
00:01:08,536 --> 00:01:09,765
That's the most common thing

28
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:11,422
that you'll do in a real application,

29
00:01:11,422 --> 00:01:14,686
is display your information in tabular format.

30
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:18,853
So, we'll modify our JSP page to make use of a table.

31
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:24,080
Now as you know, I love to do lists,

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,260
I like to do everything step by step.

33
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,699
So the first thing we're going to do is,

34
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:29,846
we're going to create a student class,

35
00:01:29,846 --> 00:01:31,953
the second thing we'll do is create that helper class

36
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:34,783
for the model Student Data Util.

37
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:37,391
Then we'll create out MVC servlet

38
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:40,788
and then finally we'll create the view JSP.

39
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:41,889
And what I'll do is I'll show you

40
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:44,057
all of these steps in the following videos.

41
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:47,196
And I'll break it up to separate videos for each step.

42
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:49,567
But don't worry we'll see everything from scratch,

43
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,729
you'll see everything step by step

44
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:55,417
and then finally at the end we'll pull it all together

45
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:59,506
as one big application so you can see it works.

46
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:01,888
So we have a lot of coding in store for us.

47
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,138
Let's go ahead and dive in.
