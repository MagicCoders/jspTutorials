1
00:00:01,295 --> 00:00:02,128
<v Instructor>Alrighty!</v>

2
00:00:02,128 --> 00:00:03,710
So we have our Servlet completed.

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:08,357
The next thing we need to do is complete our JSP view.

4
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:11,360
And in our Servlet we actually reference the file name,

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,977
the file name is "view_students_two.jsp."

6
00:00:14,977 --> 00:00:19,060
So we need to create a page with that exact name.

7
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:23,840
And what I'd like to do it just kinda

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,764
move back to my project structure.

9
00:00:25,764 --> 00:00:27,468
I'm actually gonna copy one of our

10
00:00:27,468 --> 00:00:30,549
previous JSP files and simply rename it.

11
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:32,294
So in my WebContent directory,

12
00:00:32,294 --> 00:00:35,080
we already have view_students.jsp.

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,034
I'm gonna simply copy that file

14
00:00:38,034 --> 00:00:40,274
and paste it and just rename it

15
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,073
and give it a new name.

16
00:00:42,073 --> 00:00:45,240
So here I'll choose view_students.jsp,

17
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:49,631
and I'll select this file,

18
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:53,131
and I'll do a right-click and choose Copy.

19
00:00:57,854 --> 00:00:58,687
And then what I'll do is

20
00:00:58,687 --> 00:01:02,984
I'll simply do a right-click and choose Paste.

21
00:01:02,984 --> 00:01:04,054
And for the new name

22
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:06,411
I'm gonna use that new name that we

23
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:07,653
specified in our Servlet.

24
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:10,403
So this is view_students_two.jsp.

25
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:15,012
So that's the new that we're using for this demo.

26
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:16,777
So once you're happy with all of that,

27
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:19,694
go ahead and click the Okay button.

28
00:01:25,517 --> 00:01:27,672
Okay, great, so we should have this new file here

29
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:30,423
called view_students_two.jsp.

30
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,889
So go ahead and double-click that file and open it.

31
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:35,219
And what I'll do is I'll kinda expand my window here.

32
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,852
So this is gonna be the view page for our MVC system,

33
00:01:38,852 --> 00:01:41,066
and what we need to do here is actually

34
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,925
build an HTML table.

35
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:47,738
So most of this is gonna be a HTML exercise.

36
00:01:47,738 --> 00:01:51,905
So I'll just go ahead and set up my HTML heading2 up-top.

37
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,325
Do a little horizontal line here.

38
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:59,075
And now, inside of this For Loop,

39
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:05,108
instead of simply just printing out a list of students,

40
00:02:05,108 --> 00:02:07,685
I actually want to make use of tables

41
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:10,602
and table rows, so on and so forth.

42
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:15,122
So, let me just clear up some white space here.

43
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:16,271
And on the bottom right,

44
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:18,994
you see a little picture or diagram

45
00:02:18,994 --> 00:02:20,069
as far as what we want to have

46
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:21,921
as our end result.

47
00:02:21,921 --> 00:02:24,504
A table with headings and rows.

48
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:27,791
So first off for my table,

49
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,807
I'll set up my table headings here up-top.

50
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:33,049
So, I'll make use for this...

51
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:34,189
Actually, before I get into that,

52
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:37,439
let me just set my border equal to one.

53
00:02:39,012 --> 00:02:42,160
Okay, now I can get into my table headings here.

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,814
So I'll set up a table row.

55
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:46,118
And then I'll make use of "th."

56
00:02:46,118 --> 00:02:48,183
"th" is for "table heading."

57
00:02:48,183 --> 00:02:52,126
And then I'll just give the headings here for First Name,

58
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,863
and I'll just copy-paste this line

59
00:02:54,863 --> 00:02:56,842
for the other headings here.

60
00:02:56,842 --> 00:03:00,022
So this'll be for the heading for Last Name,

61
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:01,535
and then this final column here is

62
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:04,452
the heading for Email.

63
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,415
So those are the actual table headings that we'll have here

64
00:03:08,415 --> 00:03:11,082
for our table.

65
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:25,765
All right, so, now,

66
00:03:25,765 --> 00:03:27,024
inside of our For Loop,

67
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:29,686
we're looping over those students.

68
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:30,519
That's our list,

69
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,341
student list that came our MVC Servlet.

70
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,009
Now, what I want to do here is

71
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:38,500
build up a table row and then for each cell,

72
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,492
I'mma specify information for the student.

73
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:44,765
Here, so I say tempStudent.firstName.

74
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:47,191
This'll actually call the getter method on that student,

75
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:50,919
so this'll actually call tempStudent.getFirstName().

76
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,663
And that's part of the JSP expression language.

77
00:03:53,663 --> 00:03:55,153
And we've kind of learned all this before.

78
00:03:55,153 --> 00:03:59,168
But I just wanted to reiterate that for you.

79
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:00,494
And that'll give use the first name.

80
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:03,348
And now I can just copy-paste this line

81
00:04:03,348 --> 00:04:05,911
for the other fields here.

82
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:08,999
So I'll copy-paste,

83
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,903
and I'll just update this line here for Last Name

84
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:16,486
and then also Email.

85
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:23,193
Okay great, so that's our For Loop.

86
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,504
So we're gonna loop over that student list

87
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:28,660
that was placed into the request by our MVC Servlet,

88
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,985
and then we simply loop over each one of those items,

89
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:32,318
put it into a table row,

90
00:04:32,318 --> 00:04:34,611
and for each cell, we display

91
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:36,474
First Name, Last Name, Email.

92
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,424
And we just simply loop through the list.

93
00:04:38,424 --> 00:04:39,666
So this looks really good here

94
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:43,346
as far as giving us a HTML table output,

95
00:04:43,346 --> 00:04:46,050
and we kind of built this list up on the fly.

96
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,883
Or I'm sorry.

97
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:50,566
We actually built up this table on the fly.

98
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:53,066
All right, good job.

99
00:04:58,114 --> 00:04:59,765
All right so let's go ahead and run it.

100
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:03,698
And I'll go up to this MvcDemoServletTwo,

101
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:05,148
and I'll launch it or run it.

102
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:07,144
I'll simply do a right-click,

103
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:08,741
and then I'll choose Run As,

104
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,324
Run on Server.

105
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,466
And so this will give me the output.

106
00:05:16,466 --> 00:05:17,869
So we have First Name,

107
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:18,702
Last Name,

108
00:05:18,702 --> 00:05:19,804
and Email.

109
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:21,148
So this matches what the information

110
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:23,180
that was populated by that

111
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,967
studentHelper class StudentDataUtil.

112
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,194
So this looks really good.

113
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:29,049
So this is kind of like our desired result here

114
00:05:29,049 --> 00:05:31,966
for our MVC demo.

115
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:34,936
Now, one thing I want to modify here is that

116
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,583
right now we had to run the Servlet directly.

117
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,476
I like to set up a link to the Servlet

118
00:05:39,476 --> 00:05:40,990
from an HTML page.

119
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,835
So in my WebContent directory,

120
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:45,346
I'm going to create a very simple HTML page.

121
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:46,710
So I'll simply do a right-click;

122
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,707
I'll say New,

123
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:48,594
File.

124
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:49,630
And the name of this page,

125
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,031
I'll call it index.html,

126
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:55,403
so just a very basic HTML page.

127
00:05:55,403 --> 00:05:59,070
So let's go ahead and click on Finish, here.

128
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:02,378
And basically it's a very simple page.

129
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,844
All I want to do is just have a webpage link

130
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:08,058
that'll point to my Servlet.

131
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:12,605
So I'll just set up the basic HTML body stuff.

132
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:15,772
And here I'm gonna set up a HTML link,

133
00:06:16,974 --> 00:06:19,434
so I use "a href,"

134
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:22,203
and I give the URL reference to my Servlet.

135
00:06:22,203 --> 00:06:24,786
So that's MvcDemoServletTwo.

136
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:30,940
So this will give me a hyperlink here on my page.

137
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,773
So I'll say,

138
00:06:31,773 --> 00:06:34,578
View Students with MVC Two.

139
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:37,805
So this'll build up a very basic HTML page with a link

140
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:40,388
pointing to our Servlet.

141
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:43,888
All right, so we can save this file,

142
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:45,887
and then we can run this file directly.

143
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,831
So I can simply right-click on index.html,

144
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,268
do a right-click and choose Run as,

145
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:53,851
and then Run on Server.

146
00:07:02,084 --> 00:07:03,523
Okay, great, so again,

147
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:04,724
very basic html page.

148
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,942
But hey, now this is our link.

149
00:07:05,942 --> 00:07:07,095
This is really good.

150
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,585
So now the user can simply click this link.

151
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:12,462
And it'll actually launch our MvcServlet.

152
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:14,083
So, select the link, and boom!

153
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:14,916
There we go.

154
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:15,749
We have the output.

155
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,005
So this went full-circle.

156
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:18,415
We pulled this all together.

157
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,838
So we have the request coming in from the browser,

158
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:22,017
went to our Servlet.

159
00:07:22,017 --> 00:07:24,541
It made it over to our model,

160
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:27,575
which in turn would send data over to our JSP.

161
00:07:27,575 --> 00:07:30,008
And then finally send back the results to the browser.

162
00:07:30,008 --> 00:07:32,925
So, I think we did MVC full-circle.

163
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:36,718
