1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,415
<v ->Alright, so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse.</v>

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:05,248
And what we're going to do is continue

3
00:00:05,248 --> 00:00:09,056
to use that same project Servlet demo.

4
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:11,447
So, the first thing that we need to do on our step one,

5
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:14,497
is that we need to create this Student Class.

6
00:00:14,497 --> 00:00:16,664
(Silence)

7
00:00:19,337 --> 00:00:22,738
So what I'll do is move down to my Java Resources Directory

8
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:25,818
and move into this package and, actually, what I want to do

9
00:00:25,818 --> 00:00:28,628
is create a new package just for this demo.

10
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:33,377
So, I'll just right-click and I'll say New, Package.

11
00:00:33,377 --> 00:00:35,747 line:15% 
And the name that I want to use is very similar

12
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:39,516 line:15% 
to the previous one, but I'll simply want to add on mvctwo.

13
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:42,692 line:15% 
So that's the name of the package.

14
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:43,911 line:15% 
And once we're happy with that,

15
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,361 line:15% 
we can go ahead and click Finish.

16
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:48,642
Okay, cool. So now we have this new package.

17
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:50,558
So let's go ahead and add our Student Class

18
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,501
in its new package. So this new package, mvctwo.

19
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:58,243
I'll right-click on it and I'll say New, Class.

20
00:00:58,243 --> 00:01:00,410
(Silence)

21
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:07,651
And my class name here is, this is for our student class,

22
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,851
so I'll just type in the name of Student.

23
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:11,918
And I keep all the other defaults

24
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,418
and I go ahead and hit Finish.

25
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:18,474
Okay, great. So we have this very basic class.

26
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:20,652
So we're starting from scratch here.

27
00:01:20,652 --> 00:01:23,018
So let's go ahead and define the fields here

28
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:24,993
for our student. We're going to define fields for

29
00:01:24,993 --> 00:01:28,729
firstName, lastName, and email address.

30
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:30,896
(Silence)

31
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:35,533
So we should have these three fields here,

32
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:38,074
listed for our student class for right now.

33
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:41,104
Now, what I'd like to do is also create a constructor

34
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:45,095
to help us initialize those fields when we create a student.

35
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:46,703
So let me expand the window.

36
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:48,018
So, here, let's generate a constructor.

37
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:49,017
So I'm going to use an Eclipse

38
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:51,411
trick to generate a constructor.

39
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:53,213
So I simply do a right-click, I choose Source,

40
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,632
and I choose Generate Constructor using Fields.

41
00:01:56,632 --> 00:02:00,215
Ew, pretty fancy, here. Let's try this out.

42
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:03,943
So, Eclipse will actually generate a constructor for you.

43
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:05,997
It'll generate code for you based

44
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:07,002
on the fields that you select.

45
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,822
So I'll make sure they're all selected

46
00:02:08,822 --> 00:02:12,309
and then I'll hit OK and then, Boom! Whalah!

47
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:14,506
This is cool. So Eclipse actually created

48
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:18,002
a constructor class for me that I can use later on

49
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:20,859
in my application without having to write any codes.

50
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,851
So that's a nice little Eclipse trick.

51
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,763
Okay, wait. There's more. I have one more trick for you.

52
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:29,293
We're going to make use of generating getters and setters.

53
00:02:29,293 --> 00:02:31,281
So, again, Eclipse can generate getters and

54
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:34,219
setters for you automatically.

55
00:02:34,219 --> 00:02:36,490
So what I'll do here, again, I'll right-click,

56
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,330
I'll choose Source, and now, this time,

57
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,013
I'll choose Generate Getters and Setters.

58
00:02:41,013 --> 00:02:43,180
(Silence)

59
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,603
And Eclipse will pop up a dialogue

60
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,370
with the list of fields here.

61
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,231
I'll go ahead and choose Select All

62
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,172
to make sure all of these fields are selected for

63
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,922
email, firstName, and lastName.

64
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:58,212
And I'll keep all the other defaults here.

65
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,811
And once you're happy with that,

66
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:01,852
you can go and click the OK button.

67
00:03:01,852 --> 00:03:04,042
And now Eclipse just generated a lot of code here.

68
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:08,365
(laughing) It created Getters and Setters for firstName,

69
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:09,973
email, and lastName. So, again,

70
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:13,133
a lot of coding here that we didn't have to write ourselves.

71
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:15,302
We made use of those Eclipse tricks

72
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:17,883
to generate the code for us.

73
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,604
So this pretty much takes care of everything here

74
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:21,702
for our student class and we can go ahead

75
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,432
and move on to some other work.

76
00:03:23,432 --> 00:03:25,015
So good job so far.
