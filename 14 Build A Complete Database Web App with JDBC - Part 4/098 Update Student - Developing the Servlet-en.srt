1
00:00:01,352 --> 00:00:03,302
<v Man>Alright, so we're making good progress here.</v>

2
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:04,873
So we just took care of step two,

3
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:07,266
where we prepopulated the form.

4
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:08,706
Now we're going to move on to step three

5
00:00:08,706 --> 00:00:10,822
of updating the student controller servlet.

6
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,181
So we're going to write codes to handle

7
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:15,598
the request to actually update a student.

8
00:00:16,796 --> 00:00:19,455
So let's go ahead and jump into Eclipse.

9
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,183
The first thing here is updating

10
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:23,005
our student controller servlet

11
00:00:23,005 --> 00:00:25,545
but I want to take a look at that JSP page,

12
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:28,455
our update student form dot JSP,

13
00:00:28,455 --> 00:00:30,315
because there's some good information in here

14
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:35,009
that can guide us for our next set of coding here.

15
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,019
So this is update student and this is the file

16
00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:39,536
that we just worked on in the previous video.

17
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:43,703
On lines 23 and 25, we actually have two hidden fields.

18
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,770
So we have command equals update

19
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,553
and then we have student ID and we give the student dot ID.

20
00:00:52,553 --> 00:00:53,980
So these are two perams that we're

21
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,659
sending over to the servlet.

22
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:58,111
Our servlet now needs to read that information

23
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,913
and process on it accordingly.

24
00:01:00,913 --> 00:01:02,363
So let me go ahead and open up

25
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:04,863
my student controller servlet.

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,932 line:15% 
I'll expand the window here,

27
00:01:09,932 --> 00:01:12,932 line:15% 
move down a bit to our doGet method.

28
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:16,786 line:15% 
So this is where we read in the command.

29
00:01:16,786 --> 00:01:21,330 line:15% 
And we need to add support for the update command.

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,667 line:15% 
So basically, it's just a matter of adding a new case here.

31
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,514
So we saw the previous example of case of load.

32
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:31,014
Now we'll do a case of update.

33
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:37,106
So I'll say case update and for this case,

34
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:39,396
I want to update student,

35
00:01:39,396 --> 00:01:43,563
pass in the request and response and then do a break.

36
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:48,843
Alright, so that's the basic layout.

37
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:54,444
But again, Eclipse has a little error message

38
00:01:54,444 --> 00:01:56,439
here that's saying update student

39
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,964
and if we hover over this message,

40
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:01,011
it will give us the actual error.

41
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:03,658
So it says, hey this method is not defined.

42
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:05,554
And again, Eclipse is our buddy, right

43
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:07,137
so we simply say, hey Eclipse,

44
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:09,463
go ahead and create this method for me.

45
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,742
Woo-hoo, just love it when Eclipse creates code for us.

46
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:16,277
So here's our update student that they created.

47
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:17,956
It's dubbed out right now.

48
00:02:17,956 --> 00:02:19,609
And what I want to do here, is go ahead

49
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:23,192
and start writing some code in this method.

50
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,085
So the first thing I know I'm going to need to do,

51
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,187
is actually throw an exception.

52
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:33,052
So here, I'll just say throws exception

53
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,044
and I'll just lay this out first,

54
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:36,286
just in case there are any errors,

55
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:39,047
we can handle for it accordingly, or actually,

56
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:42,101
throw the exception to the calling program.

57
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,873
Now, I always like to go through and set up comments here,

58
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,169
just to kind of keep me on tract

59
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:48,531
as far as code that I need to write.

60
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,822
And the first thing I need to do

61
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:53,489
is read the student info from the form data.

62
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:57,571
And then I need to create a new student object

63
00:02:57,571 --> 00:02:59,546
based on that form data and then,

64
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:04,118
I actually perform the update on the database.

65
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,777
And then finally, I'll send the user

66
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:08,360
back to the list students page.

67
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:14,968
So that's my basic game plan here

68
00:03:14,968 --> 00:03:17,468
for the update student method.

69
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:20,206
Alright, so let me roll my sleeves up here

70
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:23,706
and get dirty and start writing some code.

71
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,008
So for reading the student ID from the form

72
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,689
or reading the actual ID,

73
00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:32,831
so I'll say integer dot parseInt.

74
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,692
I'll say request dot get parameter: student ID

75
00:03:35,692 --> 00:03:36,603
and that's that hidden form fill

76
00:03:36,603 --> 00:03:39,436
that came in from the update form.

77
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:43,223
And then I'll go through

78
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,604
and read all the standard information.

79
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:45,881
Read the first name by saying

80
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:48,714
request get parameter, first name.

81
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,653
We've seen this stuff before.

82
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:58,026
And I'll just kinda copy paste this line

83
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:00,693
for last name and email address.

84
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:04,930
So I'll update it here for last name.

85
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:12,709
And I'll also update it here for email address.

86
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,762
Alright, cool so that's the basic work there

87
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:21,241
for reading the student info from the form data.

88
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:23,698
So now we have everything for a student

89
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:26,419
and I can use that down here on line 91

90
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,605
to actually create a new student object.

91
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:32,630
So here I'll say student the student equals new student

92
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,414
and I just pass in those parameters:

93
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:38,414
so ID, first name, last name, and email address.

94
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:46,806
Alright, that's good.

95
00:04:46,806 --> 00:04:49,272
Then using this information,

96
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:52,842
I'll actually perform an update on the database.

97
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:55,925
So I'll make use of my student Dbutil

98
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:59,783
and I'll say update student and then

99
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:03,450
I'll pass in my student object: the student.

100
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:11,661
And then finally, I'll send them back

101
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:15,239
to the list students page so list students request response.

102
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:18,516
And that's that same method we created many moons ago

103
00:05:18,516 --> 00:05:21,849
and I will simply list all the students.

104
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:27,148
But again, there is an error message here

105
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:29,815
so on line 94, Eclipse says that

106
00:05:31,022 --> 00:05:34,586
it can't find the method, update student.

107
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:38,158
And again, I'll say, hey Eclipse, why don't you help me out.

108
00:05:38,158 --> 00:05:39,960
Why don't you go ahead and create that method

109
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,431
for me in that student Dbutil?

110
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,339
So I'll select the option and now,

111
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:47,077
I'm in student Dbutil dot java

112
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:48,464
and here is this new method

113
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:50,043
that Eclipse just created for me.

114
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:52,225
So for now, I'll say do nothing.

115
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:54,373
I'll get into the details for it later

116
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:55,826
but at least I want to have this method

117
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:58,403
defined here in this class,

118
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:02,570
just so the code will compile for my actual servlet.

119
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,544
So if I move back to my sevlet,

120
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:08,377
then that error message goes away.

121
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,260
So we're in pretty good shape.

122
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,997
So this is all the coding here required

123
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:17,078
for actually doing the update student

124
00:06:17,078 --> 00:06:20,224
so we read to student info, create a new student object,

125
00:06:20,224 --> 00:06:22,251
perform an update on the database, and then

126
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,529
send them back to the list students page.

127
00:06:24,529 --> 00:06:27,222
In the next video, we'll actually drill down

128
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:30,669
into line 94 and we'll actually do the JDBC code

129
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,652
for updating the student.

130
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:35,136
And I'll cover that in the next video

131
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:36,886
so I'll see you soon.
