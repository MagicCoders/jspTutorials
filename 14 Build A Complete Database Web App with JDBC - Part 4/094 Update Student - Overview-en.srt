00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,854
<v Instructor>Hi, in this video we're going to learn</v>

2
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:07,437
how to update a student in our application.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,483
So we'll cover the following topics:

4
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:14,815
first I'll give you a demo of the Update Student feature,

5
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,609
then we'll also take a look at the big picture,

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,476
and finally we'll take a look at the sequence diagram

7
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:24,393
just to see how all the parts work together....

8
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:29,388
All right, so here's a demo of the application,

9
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:34,317
so I'm going to show you how the new Update feature works.

10
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:37,482
So notice here we have a new column called Action,

11
00:00:37,482 --> 00:00:40,076
and we have these Update links, so basically

12
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:42,492
what this Update link will do it'll actually show you

13
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:46,884
a new form and it'll pre-populate that form with data.

14
00:00:46,884 --> 00:00:49,736
So here I'm updating the student Lisa Astor,

15
00:00:49,736 --> 00:00:52,609
so again, notice how the form is already pre-populated

16
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:54,214
with her information.

17
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:57,886
Now let's say for example Lisa was married, recently married

18
00:00:57,886 --> 00:01:00,342
and she wants to change her last name to

19
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:04,405
her new married last name, so we can type in

20
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:07,451
her new last name here, and then also she wants to change

21
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:10,861
her email address, so now this is funnylisa

22
00:01:10,861 --> 00:01:15,440
and she's actually has a separate address for Gmail,

23
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,239
so funnylisa@gmail.com, so that's all of her new information

24
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,650
here that we want to update for her, uh, system.

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,331
All right, so let's go ahead and hit the Save button...

26
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,842
And good, so here's our new updated lists,

27
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:33,280
so again we sort the students by last name,

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,364
so Lisa Mangano, her new married name,

29
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:39,868
and then also her email address, funnylisa@gmail.com,

30
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:42,421
so this worked out just right, I mean,

31
00:01:42,421 --> 00:01:44,875
we updated an existing student.

32
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:47,683
Now in the video series here, we're going to break it up

33
00:01:47,683 --> 00:01:50,045
over multiple videos, and I'll actually show you

34
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:54,109
how to build all this functionality out from scratch.

35
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:56,360
All right, so here's the big picture.

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,261
So, up in the top left, we start off with

37
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:02,748
the list of students along with that new column there.

38
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:06,579
They select that new column action for update.

39
00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:09,943
It'll take them to the form, pre-populated as we saw

40
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:12,763
in the demo, and from there we'll send the data

41
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:14,476
over to the Student Controller servlet

42
00:02:14,476 --> 00:02:17,510
that'll read the form data and then it'll pass it off to

43
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,086
the Helper Class, our database util, and remember

44
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:25,253
the database util handles all the low-level JDBC work.

45
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:28,615
Now one little thing here about the action link.

46
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,782
When they click on update, each link has the student id

47
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:37,082
embedded in the link, so when they click the link,

48
00:02:37,082 --> 00:02:38,698
what we'll actually do behind the scenes that,

49
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:42,865
we'll actually load the student data from the database

50
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,745
and then we'll use that to pre-populate the form, all right,

51
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:50,727
so you'll learn all the mechanics there

52
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:54,615
on how to pre-populate a form with data from the database,

53
00:02:54,615 --> 00:02:58,249
so a nice little bonus there for you.

54
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:00,754
And finally, once you have the form pre-populated

55
00:03:00,754 --> 00:03:03,420
with information, then this is the sequence diagram

56
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,682
for actually saving the student or updating the student,

57
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:09,405
so they hit the Save button, we call Update Student

58
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:12,294
on our controller, and we pass over special command

59
00:03:12,294 --> 00:03:14,356
for update, and then from there we send it over

60
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:18,125
to our database util to actually update the student.

61
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:20,688
So that's the basic process, that's the basic

62
00:03:20,688 --> 00:03:24,061
sequence diagram for how all the different components

63
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:26,954
work together, and again we'll walk through all of this

64
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:28,787
in the video setup....

65
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,907
All right, back to my favorite to-do list.

66
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:38,941
So, the first thing we're going to do is

67
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:41,019
we're going to update the list of students,

68
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:42,915
so we're going to add that new column there

69
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:45,310
for an update link, then we'll create

70
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,925
our update student form, and we'll use that form

71
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,929
to pre-populate it with data for a given student.

72
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:53,959
Then, we're going to update our controller servlet,

73
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,725
so we're going to handle requests that are coming in

74
00:03:55,725 --> 00:04:00,076
to our updated student, and then finally we'll update

75
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:02,084
our Student DbUtil, so that's where we'll add

76
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:05,751
the low-level JDBC code for doing an update.

77
00:04:07,274 --> 00:04:11,226
And again, we'll break this up over a series of videos,

78
00:04:11,226 --> 00:04:13,886
we'll deep-dive into each step, we'll do everything

79
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:17,801
step by step, and we'll code everything from scratch,

80
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,508
just like we've done before.

81
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:22,339
All right, so, a lot of stuff in store,

82
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:25,422
I'm excited again and again, so let's go ahead and dive in,

83
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:28,505
and let's write some more code, yeah.
