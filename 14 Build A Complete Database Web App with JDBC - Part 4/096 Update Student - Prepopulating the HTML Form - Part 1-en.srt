1
00:00:00,914 --> 00:00:02,892
<v Instructor>Alright, so we've finished our first</v>

2
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:06,405
step of updating that list of students JSP.

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:10,114
Now our next step is creating the update student form.

4
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:13,027
And what we wanna do with this form is actually prepopulate

5
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:15,207
the form, when we show it.

6
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:17,903
So when the user selects a student, we're gonna prepopulate

7
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:21,320
the form with that student's information.

8
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:29,841
Now there's some behind the scenes work that we need to do.

9
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,240
And the first thing is updating our

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,136
StudentControllerServlet.

11
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:36,189
This Servlet's gonna need to read that new LOAD command,

12
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:38,671
and route it accordingly.

13
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:41,725
And then once we have that LOAD command read, we need to

14
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:43,935
read the student id from that form.

15
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:47,896
And then, take that information and read the student

16
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:51,733
from the database or get the student from the database.

17
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:54,774
Once we have the student, then we wanna show the form

18
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:58,941
and prepopulate the form with that student's data.

19
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,236
Alright, so let's go ahead and open the code here for our

20
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:06,319
StudentControllerServlet.

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,628 line:15% 
Alright, so here's our Servlet, let's go ahead and move

22
00:01:15,628 --> 00:01:17,795 line:15% 
down to the do get method.

23
00:01:23,094 --> 00:01:24,554 line:15% 
Alright, so this is the do get method

24
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:27,510 line:15% 
where we read in the actual command.

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,361 line:15% 
And what we wanna do now is add support

26
00:01:29,361 --> 00:01:31,255 line:15% 
for the LOAD command.

27
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:32,977 line:15% 
So we need to add a new case here,

28
00:01:32,977 --> 00:01:36,727
in our switch statement for the case of LOAD.

29
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:42,550
So I'll just say case LOAD,

30
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,084
and then I'll call a method load student.

31
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:49,501
And I'll pass in a request and a response.

32
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:52,001
And then I'll just do a break.

33
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,370
So this is great, well, it's almost great.

34
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,183
Again, Eclipse is giving us an error message and let's

35
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:03,350
kinda hover over that error message and see what it's about.

36
00:02:05,972 --> 00:02:09,726
And it's Eclipse saying, "Hey, buddy, you don't have this

37
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:10,905
method defined."

38
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:13,645
So then again, like we've already done before, we'll tell

39
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:17,202
Eclipse to go ahead and create that method for us.

40
00:02:17,202 --> 00:02:19,651
So, I'll simply select that second option,

41
00:02:19,651 --> 00:02:21,417
and then I'll just scroll down here.

42
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:24,413
And here's a new method that Eclipse created for me.

43
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:27,492
And again, we love it when Eclipse does work for us.

44
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:30,221
So, what I wanna do here, is I wanna remove that

45
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:34,388
Auto-generated code, and I wanna start adding my own code.

46
00:02:40,976 --> 00:02:43,036
So, the first thing I know is that I need to add a throws

47
00:02:43,036 --> 00:02:44,385
clause here for this method.

48
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:47,052
So I'll say, "throws Exception".

49
00:02:48,952 --> 00:02:50,857
So, then I'll go ahead and write some comments as far as

50
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:52,813
what I need to do in this method.

51
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:54,069
So the first thing is getting

52
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,767
the student id from the form data.

53
00:02:56,767 --> 00:03:01,562
The next thing is getting the student from the database.

54
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:03,509
Then we go ahead and place that student

55
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:05,426
in a request attribute.

56
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:16,231
And then finally, we send this to our JSP page.

57
00:03:16,231 --> 00:03:19,148
That's our update-student-form.jsp.

58
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:25,518
So those are the steps required for us

59
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:27,282
to actually load the student.

60
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,609
And again, we're doing all this preliminary work,

61
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,609
just so we can prepopulate the form.

62
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:44,754
Alright, so I can read the student id, by simply saying

63
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:48,723
the student id equals request dot get Parameter, student id.

64
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:52,306
And that's passed over by that update link.

65
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,111
Then I can talk to my database util, and get the student.

66
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,702
So I say, the student equals

67
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:01,369
student db util dot get student.

68
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:05,395
And I'll get the student based on their id.

69
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:06,973
So I'll tell them, "Hey, give me the student for this

70
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:08,473
given student id."

71
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,331
Next, what I wanna do, is take that student object

72
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:21,389
and then place it in a request attribute.

73
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:24,611
Cause our JSP page can use that to prepopulate the form.

74
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:25,444
So in here I'll just give

75
00:04:25,444 --> 00:04:27,714
the attribute name of, "THE_STUDENT".

76
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:30,217
And then the actual value a reference here,

77
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:33,884
it'll be the object on line 84, the student.

78
00:04:34,766 --> 00:04:37,933
And, hmm, seems to have an error here.

79
00:04:38,869 --> 00:04:41,673
Okay, yeah there's a typo, on line 84.

80
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:43,156
I didn't spell student properly,

81
00:04:43,156 --> 00:04:45,045
so I just did a copy, paste to fix that.

82
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:46,675
So now we're good with that one.

83
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:47,548
Okay, good.

84
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:50,039
Next what we need to do is go ahead and set up a request

85
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,755
dispatcher to send it to that update student JSP form.

86
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:56,661
So, again this is kind of standard MVC code

87
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,828
that we've written before.

88
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:05,930
So I'll get request dispatcher,

89
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,513
on update student form dot JSP.

90
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:16,364
And then finally we'll do a forward.

91
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:18,491
So, dispatch dot forward, and then I pass in

92
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,991
that request, response object.

93
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:27,526
Alright, so looking pretty good here,

94
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:30,190
there's one error message here.

95
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,190
And I'll kind of float over to see what it says.

96
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:38,883
But basically it's Eclipse saying that, "Hey we don't have

97
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:42,073
that method defined in student db util".

98
00:05:42,073 --> 00:05:44,937 line:15% 
Okay, great so that means we need to add the method,

99
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:46,219 line:15% 
to get the student from the database.

100
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:47,369 line:15% 
So I'll go ahead and tell Eclipse

101
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:49,786 line:15% 
to create that method for me.

102
00:05:53,056 --> 00:05:55,601 line:15% 
So I'll select the second option there.

103
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:57,991 line:15% 
And now I'm in the student db util class.

104
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,944 line:15% 
And right now it created a basic method, and I need

105
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,520 line:15% 
to go ahead and flush it out with my own code.

106
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,277 line:15% 
So for right now, just kind of stub it out with student,

107
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:08,757 line:15% 
the student equals null.

108
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:12,007 line:15% 
And I'll simply say return the student.

109
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:25,473 line:15% 
And now what I wanna do here is just

110
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:26,602 line:15% 
put in some comments here.

111
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:28,563 line:15% 
Well actually I'll go ahead and create some of my

112
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:30,813 line:15% 
initial JDBC objects first.

113
00:06:32,035 --> 00:06:35,285 line:15% 
So this is for the connection, my Conn.

114
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:42,331
I'll set up my statement, which is a prepared statement.

115
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,340
And I'll also set up a results set.

116
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,007
And I'll set all these values equal to null.

117
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:56,058
And then I'll sneak in another variable here,

118
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:58,317
for the student id, which we'll use a little later.

119
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,567
As far as ints.

120
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:05,351
Alright so let me go ahead and set up

121
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:08,018
a little try finally block here.

122
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:13,497
Alright, so I have that kind of stubbed out now.

123
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:16,985
And again following my standard procedure here,

124
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:19,616
I always write some comments just to keep myself on track,

125
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:23,931
when I get ready to start writing some code.

126
00:07:23,931 --> 00:07:26,063
So we convert the student id to an int.

127
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:29,071
We get the connection to a database.

128
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:33,238
Next we'll create a SQL to get the selected student.

129
00:07:35,644 --> 00:07:39,019
And then I'll go ahead and create my prepared statement.

130
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,519
Based on that SQL.

131
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:47,715
And then I'll go through and set the parameters here.

132
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:50,047
So it knows which student id to get.

133
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:52,654
And then finally I'll actually execute that query

134
00:07:52,654 --> 00:07:55,237
and then I'll get a result set.

135
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:00,181
So then once I have the result set, then I need to process

136
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:03,765
that result set and retrieve the data from that actual

137
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,015
result set row.

138
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,809
And then in my finally block I do my normal

139
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:11,253
clean up of those JDBC objects.

140
00:08:11,253 --> 00:08:13,551
We just basically close off the connection statement

141
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:14,801
and result set.

142
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,592
But anyway just kinda steppin' back for a bit.

143
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:20,522
These are all the major steps here that I need to

144
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,160
accomplish in this method, to actually

145
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,827
get a student from the database.

146
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:33,870
Alright well, let's get ready to write some code.

147
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,525
So the first thing is convertin' that student id to an int.

148
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:37,911
So we can make use of the integer

149
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:40,661
dot parse int to accomplish that.

150
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:45,181
So I just use the student id which is the string variable,

151
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:47,773
that's sent in as a method parameter.

152
00:08:47,773 --> 00:08:51,023
And we convert it to an int student id.

153
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,066
Then I go ahead and get a connection to the database.

154
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,649
Data source dot get connection.

155
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,239
Next, I create the SQL to get the selected student.

156
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,051
So basically I wanna say, "Hey give me the student

157
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:05,420
that matches this given student id."

158
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,765
So, that's accomplished with select star from student,

159
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,598
where id equals the question mark.

160
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:14,937
And we'll fill that in, in a second.

161
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:18,655
Now we just go through and actually

162
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,766
create our prepared statement.

163
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:24,933
So my conn dot prepare statement based on that SQL string.

164
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,630
And next I go through and set the parameters.

165
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,762
So there's only one parameter, I'm simply setting the

166
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:33,929
first parameter there, that matches the student id.

167
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:41,201
And I have a couple of error messages here.

168
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,749
Oh, okay, great.

169
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,043
Unhandled exception, okay great.

170
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:47,789
So let me just scroll back up to the top of this method

171
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,070
here, and simply list that as throws exception.

172
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,116
So right here on line 114, I'll say throws exception.

173
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,859
And that'll resolve all the errors that were just

174
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:59,089
popping up there in that method.

175
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,089
So the key here is throws exception.

176
00:10:05,031 --> 00:10:06,821
Alright so we can kinda get back to coding now.

177
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:08,420
(laughs)

178
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,856
Alright, so now we wanna go ahead and execute that statement

179
00:10:10,856 --> 00:10:13,178
and it's gonna give us back a result set.

180
00:10:13,178 --> 00:10:15,963
So here I'll say my rs equals

181
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:19,145
my statement dot execute query.

182
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,592
That's gonna return that result set.

183
00:10:20,592 --> 00:10:22,198
Alright so now I have this result set.

184
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:24,653
Now I have to process it or retrieve the data from

185
00:10:24,653 --> 00:10:27,048
that result set row.

186
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:29,378
And effectively what I'm gonna do here is retrieve the

187
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,461
data for a given student.

188
00:10:33,326 --> 00:10:35,561
So here I'll just set up a little if conditional.

189
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:37,283
Say if my rs dot next.

190
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:41,450
So it basically says, "Hey, do we have any rows to process?"

191
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,498
And if so, then let's go ahead and grab some of that data.

192
00:10:46,498 --> 00:10:50,266
So I need to get the actual student's first name, last name

193
00:10:50,266 --> 00:10:51,766
and email address.

194
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:58,186
So I just use the standard technique that we've seen before.

195
00:10:58,186 --> 00:11:00,933
My rs dot get string first underscore name.

196
00:11:00,933 --> 00:11:03,221
And again, first underscore name is the actual column

197
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:04,955
name from the database.

198
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,128
And then I'll just copy, paste this

199
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:07,615
for the other fields here.

200
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,516
For last name and email.

201
00:11:09,516 --> 00:11:11,683
So here we have last name.

202
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,593
Last underscore name.

203
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:16,510
Then email.

204
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:20,602
And then my rs dot get string email.

205
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:24,268
And we already have the student id.

206
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:26,675
So we don't have to query that anymore.

207
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,129
Great, so now using this information, I can actually

208
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,462
create a new student object.

209
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:36,717
And when I construct the student, I'll actually use

210
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:40,129
the student id in the constructor.

211
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:44,066
So here I say the student equals a new student and then

212
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:48,233
I'll pass in student id, comma, first name, last name

213
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:50,902
and email address.

214
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:55,723
Alright and so the key here is that we are passing

215
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:58,314
in student id, because we need that later on when

216
00:11:58,314 --> 00:12:00,064
we actually do an update.

217
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:01,922
We'll actually have to know which student,

218
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,589
that we're updating.

219
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:12,297
So for else that means we didn't find a student.

220
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:14,300
So here I'll throw an exception.

221
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,726
And I'll say new exception, cannot find student id,

222
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:19,995
and I list out that actual student id.

223
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:24,162
Alright so that takes care of this part of the coding here.

224
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,654
So basically we retrieved the data.

225
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:31,560
If there is data we grab the first name, last name, email.

226
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,963
We construct an object, else we throw an exception

227
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,963
if we couldn't find 'em.

228
00:12:39,142 --> 00:12:40,243
Alright and then the final one.

229
00:12:40,243 --> 00:12:43,189
This is really easy, we simply close those JDBC objects.

230
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:47,356
I close on my conn, comma my statement, comma my rs.

231
00:12:48,273 --> 00:12:49,440
And that's it.

232
00:12:54,806 --> 00:12:58,011
So this is in our student db util, the method get student.

233
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,876
Did all the low level JDBC work to actually

234
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:02,793
grab the student from the database.

235
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:07,121
Alright so now I can move back over to my Servlet now,

236
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:09,617
and so pretty much all the low level work on

237
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:12,444
lines 83 and 84, we just accomplished that.

238
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:16,611
We did the JDBC work inside of that database util.

239
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,381
Alright so these are all the major steps

240
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,749
here for loading a student.

241
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:25,275
We read the student id from the form,

242
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:27,017
we get 'em from the database.

243
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:29,848
We place that student in a request attribute and then

244
00:13:29,848 --> 00:13:33,579
we forward it over to that update student form dot JSP.

245
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,646
Now we haven't created the form yet.

246
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,845
We'll actually do that in the next video.

247
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:40,245
But at least wanted to get the preliminary work taken

248
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:42,498
care of before we make it there.

249
00:13:42,498 --> 00:13:44,790
So we're in really good shape right now.

250
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,575
So I'll see you in the next video.

251
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:48,408
Woo hoo.
