1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,286 line:15% 
<v ->In this video, we're gonna go ahead</v>

2
00:00:03,286 --> 00:00:07,453 line:15% 
and create our form, and pre-populate our form with data.

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,591 line:15% 
So we'll actually start with this add-student-form.jsp

4
00:00:11,591 --> 00:00:15,017 line:15% 
and I'll basically copy this form and rename it

5
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:16,658
for the update form.

6
00:00:16,658 --> 00:00:20,241
So I just do a right-click and choose Copy,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,303
and then I'll just go through and paste.

8
00:00:26,617 --> 00:00:28,283 line:15% 
So the name of this form, here I'll call it

9
00:00:28,283 --> 00:00:30,616 line:15% 
the update-student-form.jsp.

10
00:00:37,356 --> 00:00:39,054 line:15% 
And once we're happy with that name, we go ahead

11
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:40,387
and click on OK.

12
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:43,174
Alright, so let's go ahead and open up

13
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:45,507
our update-student-form.jsp.

14
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:50,829
I'll just walk through this form

15
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:53,297
and just do some cosmetic changes.

16
00:00:53,297 --> 00:00:56,434
I'll just say "Update Student" as far as the title,

17
00:00:56,434 --> 00:01:00,120
and then for the header, here I'll say "Update Student."

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,203
So just basic cosmetic changes there.

19
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:09,061
Now moving down to line 23, we're gonna change the command.

20
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,702
So instead of the Add command,

21
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:13,440
we're gonna display this new command,

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,566
or we're gonna enter this new command called Update.

23
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:18,688
So we'll send over an Update command

24
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,521
to our student controller servlet.

25
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,741
So let's go ahead and set the value here

26
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:34,889
for this text field.

27
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:36,897
So this is the value that's actually displayed

28
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:40,273
when the user actually sees the form for the first time.

29
00:01:40,273 --> 00:01:42,168
And for the actual value, what we'll do is

30
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,313
we'll actually make use of that student object

31
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,468
that was set by the servlet,

32
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:49,376
and we'll say "THE_STUDENT.firstname."

33
00:01:49,376 --> 00:01:52,177
So basically here by saying value equals,

34
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:54,518
this will actually pre-populate the field

35
00:01:54,518 --> 00:01:57,018
with the student's first name.

36
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:02,770
Now you're looking at this and you're probably wondering,

37
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,642
"Well, why is it THE_STUDENT?"

38
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:08,987
Let's go back and look at our servlet.

39
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:13,433
On our student controller servlet, for the load feature,

40
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,016
or the load method, I'll scroll down a bit.

41
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:25,768
So when we would actually load a student,

42
00:02:25,768 --> 00:02:29,826
down on lines 86 and 87, that's how we actually

43
00:02:29,826 --> 00:02:32,740
set the student in the request attribute.

44
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,566
So we'd say request.setAttribute, we'd give THE_STUDENT,

45
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:39,431
that's the attribute name, and that's the actual

46
00:02:39,431 --> 00:02:42,993
attribute name that you use in the JSP page.

47
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:46,704
So THE_STUDENT is the actual attribute name,

48
00:02:46,704 --> 00:02:49,871
and we'll use that in our actual form.

49
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:55,340
Alright, so that kind of clears up the attribute item.

50
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,799
So here, I'll use THE_STUDENT, so that's the attribute name

51
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:03,010
set by the servlet, and I'll say THE_STUDENT.firstname.

52
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,516
And it'll call the appropriate getter method

53
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:06,906
to get the first name.

54
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,753
Now I'll just copy this entry here

55
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,986
for each one of the other fields,

56
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:14,486
I'll do the same thing here for last name.

57
00:03:15,384 --> 00:03:18,967
And I'll do a copy paste, and I will change

58
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,630
this field here to say lastname.

59
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,451
So, again, this will pre-populate the field

60
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:26,868
with the student's last name.

61
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:31,735
And I'll do a similar thing here for the email address.

62
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:34,235
So I'll say THE_STUDENT.email.

63
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:43,230
Alright, so this looks pretty good.

64
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,018
So basically, this section of code here's what we use

65
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,213
to pre-populate the form with the information

66
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:50,109
from the student.

67
00:03:50,109 --> 00:03:54,026
Their first name, last name, and email address.

68
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:59,288
Actually, there's one other thing that I forgot to do here.

69
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,388
I need to add a new hidden field.

70
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:05,555
So let me copy line 23, and let me move down and paste

71
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,488
a copy of that,

72
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:11,026
and I need to set up the actual student ID,

73
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:12,937
so I need to say,

74
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:17,104
the name is studentId, and the value is THE_STUDENT.id.

75
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:20,836
What we need to do is we actually need to

76
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:22,752
track that student ID,

77
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,330
so when we actually do an update,

78
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,033
and we send it over to the servlet,

79
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,246
the servlet knows which student ID we need to

80
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:29,647
perform an update for.

81
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:32,392
So the ID here is actually very important.

82
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:35,475
So I'm glad I remembered to add that.

83
00:04:40,716 --> 00:04:42,517
Alrighty, so we can save this,

84
00:04:42,517 --> 00:04:46,512
and we can actually go through and test this form right now,

85
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:48,896
just to make sure that I can actually load

86
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:50,444
the student and pre-populate it.

87
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:54,093
So let me go ahead and run my application here.

88
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,202
They show the page, along with the update links.

89
00:04:58,202 --> 00:05:00,910
So let me kind of focus in on one of these students,

90
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,700
and just test this out.

91
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,912
So, for this first student here, Maxwell Dixon,

92
00:05:05,912 --> 00:05:07,549
let's go ahead and click the update link.

93
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:11,716
It should show the form with his information pre-populated.

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,685
Cool, this looks really, really good.

95
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:20,163
So look. Here's Maxwell Dixon.

96
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:21,965
So what happened with that update link

97
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,366
is that we actually retrieved the student

98
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:25,692
from the database, and then we would

99
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,376
actually use that information to pre-populate the form.

100
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:30,209
So this is great.

101
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:32,667
Let's try it one more time with another student.

102
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,189
Let's go back to our list,

103
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:37,272
and I'll zoom in here on Mary Public.

104
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:40,549
And I'll click on update, and, OK, again.

105
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,985
Works out just fine.

106
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:44,654
So great, so this all works out just fine.

107
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:47,948
So the whole idea of pre-populating a form,

108
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,120
we've accomplished this

109
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,404
by making use of that command equals load,

110
00:05:51,404 --> 00:05:53,808
and then we pass in the appropriate student ID.

111
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:56,874
So our servlet and DB util does work on the back end,

112
00:05:56,874 --> 00:05:58,809
and then it sends it over to the JSP

113
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,478
to pre-populate the form.

114
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:02,779
So this is really good.

115
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,546
I'm happy, I'm excited,

116
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:07,011
because we're making some really good progress.

117
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:08,761
So, good job so far.
