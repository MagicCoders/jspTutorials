1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,679
<v Instructor>All right, so making good progress.</v>

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,600
We've just completed step three.

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,669
Now we're gonna focus on step four,

4
00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:08,859
updating our student database util

5
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:10,600
and again, this is where we're gonna add

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,388
our low-level JDBC code

7
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:15,805
for updating the student in the database.

8
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:22,059
All right, so just moving back to our servlet here

9
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,235
on line 94 is where we actually have the code

10
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:29,402 line:15% 
where we make a call to the StudentDBUtil updateStudent

11
00:00:30,383 --> 00:00:32,383 line:15% 
but right now that's just a placeholder

12
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:34,803 line:15% 
and we need to write some real code inside of that method,

13
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:36,994 line:15% 
so let me go ahead and navigate to that method,

14
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:39,652
so I'll simply do a right click,

15
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:41,478
and I'll say Open Declaration

16
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:43,656
and again, this is the Eclipse trick.

17
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:45,510
This will actually take us to the code here

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,250
for StudentDBUtil,

19
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,716
so that's where I'm at, I'm in StudentDBUtil right now

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,327
and I have just this empty shell of a method here

21
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:53,744
for updateStudent

22
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,676
and what I'll do is I'll go ahead

23
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:57,909
and write all my real code here

24
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:01,242
for doing all the real JDBC work for us.

25
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,659
And let me stretch out, get some more white space here

26
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:06,826
at the bottom.

27
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,708
I'll clear out all the comments there.

28
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,314
I know I'll have throws Execution up top,

29
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:18,481
so I'm gonna go ahead and put that in for right now.

30
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,871
And let me just set up some JDBC objects first

31
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:24,946
and set everything to null,

32
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:27,471
so I'll set up a connection for myConn,

33
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:30,396
I'll set up a PreparedStatement,

34
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:31,563
and that's it.

35
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,618
Now I'll go through and write some comments,

36
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:39,520
again just to keep myself on track.

37
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,563
So, the first thing I'll do

38
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,144
is get a connection to the database.

39
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,977
The next thing I'll do

40
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:47,144
is I'll create a SQL update statement.

41
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,191
Then I'll actually prepare that statement

42
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:54,523
and then I'll set the params for that statement

43
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:57,904
and then finally, I'll execute the SQL statement

44
00:01:57,904 --> 00:02:02,071
that'll actually perform the update on the database.

45
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:09,709
So, that's kind of the main game plan here

46
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,626
for updating a student.

47
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,568
All right, so let's start cutting some code here.

48
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:20,974
So, first off I'll get the data connection,

49
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:25,141
so I'll say myConn equals dataSource.getConnection.

50
00:02:30,268 --> 00:02:32,542
Now I'll go through and actually set a SQL string here,

51
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:36,209
so I'll say String sql equals update student

52
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:45,018
and I'll set first_name equals to a question mark,

53
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:46,306
last_names equals a question mark

54
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:49,235
and email equals the question mark

55
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,464
and again, these question marks are simply placeholders

56
00:02:51,464 --> 00:02:54,063
for those prepared statements

57
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:58,267
and I'll update the student where ID equals

58
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:02,429
and that's whatever the ID that we pass in.

59
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:03,330
So, that's the SQL

60
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,163
and also one thing here,

61
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:07,593
make sure you have an extra white space at the end

62
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:09,824
on lines 172 and 173

63
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:12,868
'cause they're gonna concatenate this string altogether

64
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:14,058
and you need to have a space there

65
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,537
and so you don't run into any problems

66
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,510
but that's the basic SQL there

67
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,427
for updating a student.

68
00:03:23,788 --> 00:03:24,689
So, the next thing we need to do

69
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:26,153
is prepare the statement,

70
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:30,530
so here I'll say myStatement equals myConn.prepareStatement,

71
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,037
I pass in that SQL that I just created

72
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:34,040
from the previous line,

73
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,623
so that looks good.

74
00:03:36,578 --> 00:03:39,007
Now I'll go through and I'll actually set the parameters,

75
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:40,691
so again, these question marks

76
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:44,521
are parameters and they start at position one

77
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:45,491
and they go left to right,

78
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,059
so I simply set the first parameter

79
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:50,917
which is the student's first name

80
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:53,021
and I'll simply copy this line

81
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:55,454
and I'll paste it for the other lines

82
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:57,789
for LastName and email,

83
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:00,706
so position two is LastName

84
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,413
and position three is email

85
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:05,681
and again it's all one base starting at one

86
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,069
and then that fourth parameter,

87
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,083
or our fourth question mark here

88
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:13,250
is ID, so I'll say myStatement.setInt(4, theStudent.getId).

89
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:24,081
All right, so that looks good there for the params,

90
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:26,426
then finally we just execute the statement,

91
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:30,259
so I'll say myStatement.execute and that's it.

92
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:47,295
Now, I also need to put this code in a try finally block,

93
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,219
so let me go ahead and do the finally here

94
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:51,222
and in the finally I actually want to do a clean up

95
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:52,847
on those JDBC objects,

96
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:57,014
so I'll say close and I'll close myConn, myStatement

97
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,269
and there's no result set,

98
00:04:59,269 --> 00:05:01,373
so I'll simply pass in null for that,

99
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:03,027
so null means results set,

100
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:05,387
but there's no results set in this example

101
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:08,054
and I have a finally but no try.

102
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,699
Yikes.

103
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,532
Yucky.

104
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,746
So, I need to kind of fix this code up a bit,

105
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:17,330
so let me copy this finally stuff

106
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,163
and cut it and move it right here,

107
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,783
so there's my finally

108
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,637
and now I need to move up top

109
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,804
right at 168 and do a try.

110
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,625
Okay, so that kind of takes care of that,

111
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,815
so now I have a try block at the beginning,

112
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:39,426
scroll down, end the try block on 188

113
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,806
and okay, so I'm okay.

114
00:05:40,806 --> 00:05:44,368
So, now let me go ahead and just tab this stuff in,

115
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:45,616
there we go, that's tabbed in

116
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:48,037
and click this stuff, tab this in,

117
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:48,967
so I kind of made a mistake,

118
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:50,532
I'm having a clean up here

119
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:54,115
but anyways, we have this try block up top.

120
00:05:55,057 --> 00:05:56,300
All right, actually we'll start from the top,

121
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
so we have updateStudent

122
00:06:01,058 --> 00:06:03,522
and I set up my JDBC objects

123
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:05,355
and then I do the try.

124
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,235
We roll through and we get our database connection,

125
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,902
we do our SQL stuff,

126
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,751
prepare the statement,

127
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:21,472
set some params,

128
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:26,067
and then execute, okay, cool,

129
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:29,779
and so 188 we have our closed curly for that try

130
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,910
and then we have our finally block here

131
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,218
which we clean up

132
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:35,758
and that close curly, good.

133
00:06:35,758 --> 00:06:36,971
So, that's good, so we're okay now,

134
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:37,959
we're in good shape

135
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,284
and also just as a good checkpoint,

136
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:41,952
make sure you have two curly braces

137
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:44,180
right after that and then you should be okay

138
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,633
and if there's any syntax errors,

139
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:46,505
Eclipse will let you know

140
00:06:46,505 --> 00:06:48,854
but there we go, we're all kind of laid out here,

141
00:06:48,854 --> 00:06:50,635
so this looks good so far.

142
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:52,912
Great, so that's our low-level JDBC code here

143
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,537
for updating a student in the database.

144
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:57,565
Good job.

145
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:00,480
So, now I think we can go ahead and test this thing out.

146
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,813
So, let's go back to our app and run it.

147
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,254
And our app's up and running.

148
00:07:08,254 --> 00:07:10,428
Okay, great, so now we should be able to update

149
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:12,675
a student, so let's select one of these students here

150
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,008
and update them.

151
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:19,678
So, let's see, I'll try Maxwell Dixon.

152
00:07:19,678 --> 00:07:21,414
Okay, click on Update

153
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:25,164
and I'm gonna change his last name to Apples.

154
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,197
So, Maxwell Apples

155
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:38,278
and then I'll hit the Save button

156
00:07:40,136 --> 00:07:41,125
and I'll take a look at the list

157
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,516
and whoa, yeah, all right,

158
00:07:43,516 --> 00:07:46,009
so his last name was updated,

159
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:49,706
so Maxwell Apples is now in our class.

160
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:51,449
Good, let's try it one more time.

161
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,616
Let's see, Mary Public, okay, let's change Mary Public.

162
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:01,425
So, let's go and hit the Update button here

163
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:03,789
and we'll change her last name,

164
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:05,834
instead of Public she's Private.

165
00:08:05,834 --> 00:08:07,951
I don't know, being geeky

166
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:11,777
like a Java public private detective.

167
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:14,762
So, now she's Private and we'll change her email address,

168
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:16,012
mary@gmail.com,

169
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,156
so we're updating last name and email

170
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:25,087
and then we can go ahead and click on Save

171
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,777
and yeah, that looks good, Mary Private, mary@gmail.com.

172
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,531
Excellent, whoa.

173
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:33,329
Man, this is awesome.

174
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:35,136
Now, I'm happy, excited

175
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:39,942 line:15% 
but I'm thinking well, we should really check this

176
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,275 line:15% 
in the database.

177
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:45,097 line:15% 
We need to make sure this stuff is really out there

178
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:46,924 line:15% 
and there's no smoke and mirrors,

179
00:08:46,924 --> 00:08:49,461
so let's go ahead and log into our database.

180
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:52,378
Let's go to our web_student_tracker

181
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,854
and our Tables, go to student,

182
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,578
select and there we go.

183
00:08:58,578 --> 00:08:59,411
So, this looks good,

184
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:03,454
so there's Mary Private, mary@gmail.com,

185
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:05,471
so that's great and then the other person

186
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:08,691
we played around with was Maxwell, yeah, Maxwell Apples,

187
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:09,574
so this is great.

188
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:11,157
So, sigh of relief.

189
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,039
This works out just fine.

190
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,099
We're updating students in the database

191
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,896
and we kind of went through all

192
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:21,432
of the coding process for that.

193
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:24,422
That included pre-populating the form,

194
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:25,655
reading the input

195
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:28,496
and then saving it and updating it in the database,

196
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:30,744
so I'm excited now.

197
00:09:30,744 --> 00:09:33,862
So, I would say good job for you,

198
00:09:33,862 --> 00:09:35,252
give yourself a pat on the back

199
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:38,109
and we are making excellent progress here.

200
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:39,609
I'm excited, whoa.
