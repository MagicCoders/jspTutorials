1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,678
<v Instructor>All right, so let's get started.</v>

2
00:00:02,678 --> 00:00:04,817
So, the first item on our To Do List here

3
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:08,132
is to update the list-students.jsp

4
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,632
and add the new "Update" link.

5
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,653
So, the main thing here is that

6
00:00:15,653 --> 00:00:17,268
we're gonna have this new column

7
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,115
that we're gonna add, and this column's

8
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:22,205
gonna have an Update link for each student.

9
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:26,607
Now, this link will actually contain the embedded student ID

10
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:29,223
and we'll be able to use this later on

11
00:00:29,223 --> 00:00:32,136
when we need to pre-populate the form.

12
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:34,162
We'll cover that later, but for right now

13
00:00:34,162 --> 00:00:36,330
the main focus of this video is simply

14
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,861
to create that new column and also

15
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:42,194
create the Update link for each student.

16
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,714 line:15% 
All right, so let's go ahead and move into the clips.

17
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,166 line:15% 
The main focus here is to update

18
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:53,249 line:15% 
the list-students.jsp and to add that new column.

19
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,582
All right, so I have the file open.

20
00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:01,746
Let me go ahead and expand the file

21
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,437 line:15% 
and then let's move down to the section

22
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:06,270 line:15% 
where we set up our table headers.

23
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:10,120 line:15% 
And what I'm gonna do here is add a new column,

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,037 line:15% 
so I'll have a new column here called "Action."

25
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:22,483
All right, so we have our column in place now.

26
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:25,410
Now, the next thing we need to do is actually

27
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,029
set up a reference here for the actual Update link,

28
00:01:30,029 --> 00:01:34,456
so I'll set up a new piece of information here

29
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:36,785
and instead of doing the real link for right now

30
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:39,230
I'll just put some little placeholder text

31
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,148
just to kinda get us going for right now.

32
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:46,574
So, a little to do comment to myself to add a link here.

33
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,147
I just want to make sure that I have our normal

34
00:01:48,147 --> 00:01:50,332
html stuff laying out properly

35
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:53,665
before I get into all of the link stuff.

36
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:58,347
All right, so let's go ahead and test this file here

37
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:01,542
for a second, so I'll just do a quick run.

38
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,965
And okay, this looks good, so we have our new column

39
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:05,971
called Action and we have our little

40
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,904
to do statement for add a link here.

41
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:10,166
So, this is good so far.

42
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,138
So, we have the basics in place, but now

43
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:16,221
let's get into all the fancy coding aspect of it.

44
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:22,917
So, I'll move back into my list-students.jsp

45
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:24,488 line:15% 
and the main thing here is that I want

46
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:28,071 line:15% 
to actually set up a link for each student.

47
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,837 line:15% 
And in order to help me create these links

48
00:02:33,837 --> 00:02:38,004 line:15% 
I'm actually gonna make use of a JSTL feature called URL.

49
00:02:38,996 --> 00:02:42,011
So, this'll actually define a link to a URL

50
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:44,304
and we can also pass some parameters to it,

51
00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:45,577
so it's a very nice feature.

52
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:48,463
So this is one of the JSTL tags we'll make use of here,

53
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:52,193
and you'll see it kinda real world, see how it works.

54
00:02:52,193 --> 00:02:55,076
So, I'm gonna set up a variable name for that URL

55
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:58,828
called tempLink, and then for the value itself

56
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:01,806
I'll point to our student controller servlet.

57
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,827
Now, I have two parameters that I want to send over

58
00:03:04,827 --> 00:03:06,827
to the student controller servlet,

59
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:10,083
but first parameter is I'll give the actual command.

60
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:13,244
So, we'll have a new command called LOAD,

61
00:03:13,244 --> 00:03:14,831
then the next parameter which is

62
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:18,869
really important is the actual studentId.

63
00:03:18,869 --> 00:03:21,162
I want to be able to give the actual studentId

64
00:03:21,162 --> 00:03:23,789
of this student that I'm using right now,

65
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:27,033
so I'll say tempStudent.id, and note here

66
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:29,558 line:15% 
I'm using the JSP expression language

67
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:33,070 line:15% 
to get the current ID of that student.

68
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,407 line:15% 
So, in effect it's gonna create multiple links here

69
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:41,574 line:15% 
for each student with their embedded ID already in there.

70
00:03:47,016 --> 00:03:48,746
Now, let me take this link and actually

71
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:51,544
use it in my table, because up above

72
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,587
we only defined it, we didn't actually

73
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:55,687
display it or reference it.

74
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:58,461
So, here I'll set up an HREF and I'll point

75
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:02,545
to this tempLink that was defined up on line 43,

76
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:03,935
and then I'll give the actual text

77
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,466
that you'll see in the table, Update.

78
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:09,526
So, this'll basically create an HREF

79
00:04:09,526 --> 00:04:11,459
with the text of Update, and then

80
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,352
embedded is the actual tempLink

81
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:16,685
that has the command and the student ID.

82
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,732
All right, so that's how we pull it together,

83
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:24,995
that's how we can embed a link.

84
00:04:24,995 --> 00:04:27,180
Let's go ahead and test it out and see what it...

85
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,673
See how it works.

86
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:31,200
So, again, I'll go back to my application.

87
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,783
I'll simply do just a refresh on this page.

88
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,698
And cool, this looks good.

89
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:41,739
So, here's our Action column and now

90
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,989
we have these HREF links called Update,

91
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:48,147
and if you just kind of scroll over each one

92
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:50,415
of those links in the bottom left

93
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,939
you'll notice that the ID changes,

94
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,351
and you may not be able to see it because of the video,

95
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:56,813
but what I'll do is I'll actually copy

96
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:59,515
one of these links and I'll just put it into a text editor

97
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:02,913
just so you can see what's behind there.

98
00:05:02,913 --> 00:05:04,865
So, here's one of the sample links there,

99
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,098
so it's gonna send something to the

100
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:10,265
student controller servlet, command=LOAD, and studentId=5.

101
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:15,381
So, the really cool thing about it is that

102
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,595
that value of studentId will change for each student.

103
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:23,604
So, each link has a unique studentId that it's

104
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:27,631
pointing to because we built this up dynamically.

105
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:28,834
So, this is really cool.

106
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:31,445
So, we have the first part of it taken care of.

107
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:33,796
In the following video I'm gonna show you

108
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:36,917
how to update our controller servlet to actually

109
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:41,398
read the command and also read the studentId

110
00:05:41,398 --> 00:05:44,949
and use that information to pre-populate the form,

111
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,897
but this is a good first step and we have a lot of

112
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,775
good things coming up in the next video,

113
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:50,775
so I will see you there.
