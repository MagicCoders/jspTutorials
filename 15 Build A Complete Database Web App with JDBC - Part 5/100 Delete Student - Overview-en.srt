00:00:01,313 --> 00:00:04,402
<v ->In this video, we're gonna learn how to delete a student</v>

2
00:00:04,402 --> 00:00:06,485
in our classroom project.

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,532
So we'll cover the following topics:

4
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:14,156
first off, I'll give you a demo of the application

5
00:00:14,156 --> 00:00:15,839
for deleting a student,

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,911
then we'll look at the big picture,

7
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,309
and then we'll also look at the sequence diagram

8
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:23,726
just to see how everything fits together.

9
00:00:27,296 --> 00:00:30,095
Alright, so let's start off with a demo of the application.

10
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:33,479
Note here on the far right, we have a new column

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,895
for delete, and that's a new link here,

12
00:00:35,895 --> 00:00:39,978
and each link has the actual student ID embedded.

13
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:43,175
Now when I click on this link,

14
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:44,648
the application's gonna prompt me,

15
00:00:44,648 --> 00:00:47,685
"Hey, are you sure you wanna delete this student?"

16
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:50,609
In this case, I'll hit cancel, so note nothing happened

17
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,310
to the application, nothing happened to the data.

18
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,648
But now let's go ahead and actually delete a user.

19
00:00:55,648 --> 00:00:58,098
So we're gonna delete Lisa Mangano,

20
00:00:58,098 --> 00:00:59,348
we click on OK,

21
00:01:02,806 --> 00:01:06,180
and note Lisa Mangano is no longer in the list.

22
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,453
She was deleted from our application,

23
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:10,267
actually deleted from the database.

24
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:11,734
Let's try it one more time.

25
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:14,092
Here's a guy at the bottom, Maxwell Zeno.

26
00:01:14,092 --> 00:01:17,211
We'll hit delete, and then we'll hit OK,

27
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,935
and Maxwell Zeno is now gone.

28
00:01:19,935 --> 00:01:24,102
So we're basically deleting users from the database.

29
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:29,412
Now let's take a look at the big picture here.

30
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:31,804
So, we're gonna have this list-students.jsp,

31
00:01:31,804 --> 00:01:34,965
it has that column with the new link here for delete,

32
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:38,953
they'll select that link, go over to our controller servlet,

33
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:41,008
this person will read that delete command,

34
00:01:41,008 --> 00:01:43,409
and then pass it off to our database util,

35
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,255
and that person will handle the low-level JDBC code

36
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:50,172
for deleting a given student from the database.

37
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:57,399
Now a little bit more about this action link.

38
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,036
So, each row will have a delete link,

39
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:03,862
and basically this link has the current student ID

40
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,944
embedded inside of it.

41
00:02:05,944 --> 00:02:07,319
So, like you saw on the demo,

42
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,567
when you click this link, it'll prompt the user first,

43
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:14,734
it'll actually go and delete the student from the database.

44
00:02:19,094 --> 00:02:20,677
Now here's the sequence diagram,

45
00:02:20,677 --> 00:02:23,245
just more behind-the-scenes work here,

46
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:27,157
so this list-students.jsp, the user clicks the delete link.

47
00:02:27,157 --> 00:02:30,185
It's gonna call the doGet method on our servlet,

48
00:02:30,185 --> 00:02:33,784
and we'll pass over a command=DELETE.

49
00:02:33,784 --> 00:02:36,014
Our servlet will take that command, say okay, now we need

50
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:38,482
to to a delete, and then it'll actually call

51
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:41,870
the deleteStudent method on our database util.

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,618
And this is very similar to what we've done

53
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:46,140
in all of the previous videos.

54
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,036
Alright, so I love my to-do list.

55
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,629
So the first thing we're gonna do is add a delete link

56
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,222
to the JSP,

57
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:55,495
then we'll add code to that controller servlet

58
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:58,653
to handle the processing of that delete command,

59
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:01,765
then we'll add code to our student database util

60
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,614
to actually do the low-level JDBC work

61
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,253
for deleting a student.

62
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,659
So that's the game plan.

63
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:11,239
I'm excited, I'm ready to write some code.

64
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:14,322
And we'll do everything from scratch.
