1
00:00:01,222 --> 00:00:02,612
<v Instructor>All right, so in this video</v>

2
00:00:02,612 --> 00:00:03,936
we're actually gonna add the code

3
00:00:03,936 --> 00:00:06,599
for deleting the student from the controller servlet

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:08,384
and the database util.

5
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:11,545
We'll cover steps two and three in this one video,

6
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:12,891
we'll kind of just mash it altogether

7
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:14,823
because the code is really short

8
00:00:14,823 --> 00:00:16,906
for those two operations.

9
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,635
All right, diving back into Eclipse,

10
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:23,931
first off, I want to take a look

11
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:26,337
at that list-students.jsp

12
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:28,149
just to get a handle on the parameters

13
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,149
that are being passed to our controller servlet.

14
00:00:33,223 --> 00:00:35,054
So, moving on down we have this link

15
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:37,562
that we set up to actually delete a student,

16
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:39,953
that's lines 48 through 52,

17
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:41,548
so note here, there are two parameters

18
00:00:41,548 --> 00:00:44,273
that are going to our student controller servlet.

19
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:47,364
We're passing over command equals delete

20
00:00:47,364 --> 00:00:48,969
and then we're passing over a student ID

21
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,386
and that's the tempStudent.Id

22
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:56,047
and information's being passed over to our actual servlet

23
00:00:56,047 --> 00:00:59,178
and then our servlet's gonna actually read that information.

24
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:00,979
So, let me go ahead and open up my servlet,

25
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,312
my StudentControllerServlet.

26
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:08,633 line:15% 
And let me move down to my doGet method

27
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:11,256 line:15% 
and here we're actually going to add support

28
00:01:11,256 --> 00:01:13,173 line:15% 
for the delete command.

29
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:18,360 line:15% 
So, this is where we would normally read the commands

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,110 line:15% 
and now we need to add a new case for delete.

31
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:25,961 line:15% 
So, very similar to all the code

32
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,510 line:15% 
we've created so far,

33
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,427 line:15% 
so case DELETE and then I'll say deleteStudent,

34
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:35,309 line:15% 
pass in a request and a response

35
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:39,779 line:15% 
and then do a break.

36
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:45,897
All right and again, just like before,

37
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,043
Eclipse will say hey,

38
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:52,454
I don't know about this method called deleteStudent

39
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:54,120
and so, we simply tell Eclipse

40
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,035
to create that method for us,

41
00:01:56,035 --> 00:01:57,424
so we just hover over,

42
00:01:57,424 --> 00:01:58,786
they give us the options,

43
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,869
we choose the option create method deleteStudent.

44
00:02:06,097 --> 00:02:07,734
And by now we're just so used to Eclipse

45
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:09,309
creating code for us,

46
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:12,184
we're just really good friends now.

47
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:13,421
All right, so here's the method

48
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:16,838
that Eclipse just created, deleteStudent.

49
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,771
I'll remove the auto generated code

50
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,206
and I'll add a throws here,

51
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:26,628
so let me move to the end of this method declaration,

52
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:28,774
right before the curly brace,

53
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,149
I'll hit enter, right before the curly brace

54
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:34,443
to get it down to the next line with me

55
00:02:34,443 --> 00:02:36,647
and then I'll say throws Exception

56
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:38,272
and again, we're following the same pattern

57
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:40,550
that we've used for all of our other code here

58
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,633
in this servlet, so throws Exception.

59
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:51,193
And by now you know my procedure,

60
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:52,540
you know my process,

61
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,641
writing some comments here to keep me on track,

62
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,165
so the first thing I do is read the student ID

63
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:58,748
from the form data,

64
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:03,676
then I delete the student from the database

65
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:10,246
and then finally, I send the user back

66
00:03:10,246 --> 00:03:12,413
to the list students page.

67
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,218
So, this is my basic game plan here

68
00:03:16,218 --> 00:03:18,044
for the deleteStudent method

69
00:03:18,044 --> 00:03:19,961
that's in this servlet.

70
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:28,744
All right, rolling up my sleeves here,

71
00:03:28,744 --> 00:03:29,676
writing some code,

72
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,154
so to read theStudentId,

73
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:35,321
I simply say request.getParameter("studentId"),

74
00:03:36,604 --> 00:03:38,771
I assign that accordingly.

75
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:42,144
Then to actually delete the student

76
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:46,311
from a database, I'll make use of my studentDbUtil

77
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,974
and I'll say studentDbUtil.deleteStudent

78
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:56,115
and then I pass in that StudentId.

79
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,956
And again, you're used to this part of it,

80
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:05,839
send them back to the list students page,

81
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,174
we simply say listStudents

82
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:09,423
and we pass the request response,

83
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,262
so we're kind of in the rhythm

84
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:13,455
of how we develop applications now

85
00:04:13,455 --> 00:04:16,759
and again, another part of our motion or rhythm here

86
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,267
is that Eclipse will give us an error message

87
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:22,370
saying hey, we don't know about this method

88
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,459
deleteStudent in the studentDbUtil.

89
00:04:24,459 --> 00:04:25,965
Well, of course, this is all new code,

90
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:28,055
so again, we'll highlight it

91
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:29,822
and then we'll go down and we'll choose the option

92
00:04:29,822 --> 00:04:32,487
create the method deleteStudent

93
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:34,320
and the studentDbUtil.

94
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:44,077
All right, so there we go,

95
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:46,278
Eclipse is creating more code for us.

96
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:49,657 line:15% 
So, we're inside of studentDbUtil right now

97
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:53,542 line:15% 
and there's the method that Eclipse just created for us

98
00:04:53,542 --> 00:04:55,022 line:15% 
and what we have to do here

99
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:58,344 line:15% 
is we actually have to add the JDBC code

100
00:04:58,344 --> 00:04:59,476 line:15% 
to delete the student,

101
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:01,711 line:15% 
so we'll have to write the low-level code

102
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:04,211 line:15% 
to interact with the database.

103
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:10,263
So, up top I'll set up throws Exception

104
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:12,599
for this method signature.

105
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:16,766
Again, following the pattern that we've used before,

106
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:20,061
I'll define some of my JDBC objects up front,

107
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:21,782
so I'm gonna need a connection,

108
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,608
I'll say myConn equals null

109
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:25,274
and I also need a prepared statement,

110
00:05:25,274 --> 00:05:29,441
I'll call it myStatement and I'll set this one to null also.

111
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,557
And then I'll set up a try finally block

112
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,413
and this time I'll actually do this first

113
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:38,483
as opposed to last time.

114
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:40,630
If you recall from one of the previous videos

115
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,835
I didn't write all the code properly

116
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:44,302
and I had to go back and clean up.

117
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,143
Got a little messy, so I'll make sure I'm on track here,

118
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:48,972
so try finally up front,

119
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:50,640
now I write the comments here,

120
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,840
so the first thing here is converting the student ID

121
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,007
to an integer,

122
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:59,768
then we get a connection to the database,

123
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,169
next we create the SQL to actually delete the student,

124
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:08,111
then we prepare the statement,

125
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:09,791
we set up the params

126
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:14,318
and then finally, we execute the SQL statement

127
00:06:14,318 --> 00:06:18,485
and that'll actually perform the delete on the database.

128
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,351
And in my cleanup section here

129
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,518
I need to clean up those JDBC objects that I used.

130
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,083
All right, so this is basically the game plan here

131
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,583
for this deleteStudent method.

132
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:46,089
Okay, so let's go ahead and dig in.

133
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:47,495
So, the first item of business here

134
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:49,623
is converting the student ID to an int,

135
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:52,221
so here I say int studentId equals

136
00:06:52,221 --> 00:06:54,687
and I make use of that Integer.parseInt

137
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:57,604
to convert from a string to an int.

138
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:01,935
Then I get a connection to the database

139
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:05,935
by using myConn equals dataSource.getConnection.

140
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:12,393
Then we just write out the SQL for doing a delete,

141
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:15,145
so here I say delete from student

142
00:07:15,145 --> 00:07:17,510
where ID equals and then we use

143
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,496
that question mark placeholder.

144
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:23,663
That's the placeholder that we use for prepared statements.

145
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,877
Now let's go ahead and prepare the statement

146
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:35,044
by saying myStatement equals myConn.prepareStatement.

147
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:42,320
Then I'll go ahead and set the params here

148
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,737
by saying myStatement.setint,

149
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:47,567
that's the first param,

150
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,900
so one, the actual studentId

151
00:07:52,146 --> 00:07:54,696
so they know which student to delete

152
00:07:54,696 --> 00:07:57,846
and then we can get busy here,

153
00:07:57,846 --> 00:08:00,005
so here I'll say myStatement.execute

154
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,728
and that'll actually perform the operation

155
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:04,235
on the database and actually delete the student

156
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,735
from the database.

157
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,400
And then finally, we just clean up our JDBC code,

158
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,983
so we close myConn, myStatement

159
00:08:17,878 --> 00:08:19,337
and since we didn't have a result set here,

160
00:08:19,337 --> 00:08:21,355
we just pass in the value of null

161
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:23,355
and that's basically it.

162
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,799
So, that's the code here for deleteStudent.

163
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:36,391
And so, you've seen this pattern before,

164
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,177
so you're probably really close

165
00:08:38,177 --> 00:08:40,001
at being able to write all this code yourself

166
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,831
'cause we've gone through a number of iterations

167
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,426
for this already.

168
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:46,926
So, making some really good progress here.

169
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,372
Alrighty, so we can save this

170
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:56,460
and go ahead and move back to our servlet,

171
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,898
so this is our servlet code

172
00:08:57,898 --> 00:09:00,117
and this is in pretty good shape for right now,

173
00:09:00,117 --> 00:09:02,116
so our deleteStudent,

174
00:09:02,116 --> 00:09:03,669
we read the student ID,

175
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,327
we delete the student from the database

176
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,035
and we send them back to the list students page

177
00:09:07,035 --> 00:09:08,947
and that's basically everything involved here

178
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:13,114
for deleting a student from the servlet's point of view.

179
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:21,096
Okay, well, let's go ahead and run this and test it out.

180
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:24,763
So, here, right click, Run As, Run on Server

181
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:29,939
and great, so here's the output of our application.

182
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:31,752
Let's go ahead and choose the Delete link

183
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:33,144
along the far right

184
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:33,977
and I'll choose it

185
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:36,668
for this first student here, Maxwell Apples.

186
00:09:36,668 --> 00:09:38,751
So, I'll click on Delete,

187
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:40,871
and the system's going to prompt me,

188
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,918
this is the little JavaScript prompt.

189
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,151
Here I'll hit Cancel

190
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:46,091
and note, nothing happened on the app

191
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:49,012
which is good 'cause we canceled that operation

192
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:50,737
but let's go ahead and really delete the person

193
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:51,654
and hit OK.

194
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,970
So, now Maxwell Apples is gone,

195
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,634
I'll list refresh and he's no longer in our list of students

196
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:00,384
which is really good.

197
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,434
Let's try this again.

198
00:10:04,874 --> 00:10:07,223
Let's see Mary or Andrew, let's see which one,

199
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:11,238
not sure and let's go ahead and delete Mary Private.

200
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:13,228
So, let's go ahead and delete Mary Private.

201
00:10:13,228 --> 00:10:16,317
We'll click Delete and then we'll hit OK.

202
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:19,608
And now let's delete Andrew Whittaker

203
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:20,640
and then we'll hit OK.

204
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,731
So, great, so we just deleted three students,

205
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:26,397 line:15% 
we only have three left and this looks really good

206
00:10:26,397 --> 00:10:29,314 line:15% 
but again, let's check the database

207
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:34,140 line:15% 
just to make sure this thing is really working.

208
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,272 line:15% 
So, I'll go ahead and move into MySQL

209
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:40,723 line:15% 
and I will move over to my database here,

210
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,233
web_student_tracker, I'll choose Tables,

211
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:46,380
I'll right click on student

212
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,213
and boom, really good,

213
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,699
we only have three students in our database,

214
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:56,866
so that Apples and Mary Private and Andrew Whittaker,

215
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:01,758
they're gone, they're deleted, poof, be gone.

216
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,807
All right, so this is good stuff.

217
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,362
I'm having too much fun here.

218
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:08,100
So, anyway this works out just fine,

219
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,377
so we wrote the code for deleting a student

220
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:12,927
and we went through it step by step.

221
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,637
We built it all from scratch

222
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:16,568
and hopefully you have a good feel

223
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:17,991
for how this process works

224
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:22,325
especially after doing it for like a third or fourth time.

225
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:25,718
So, again, I'm happy, we've made some really good progress,

226
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,371
you can pat yourself on the back

227
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,538
and good job.
