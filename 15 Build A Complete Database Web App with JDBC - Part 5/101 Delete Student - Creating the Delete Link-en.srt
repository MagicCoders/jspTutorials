1
00:00:01,481 --> 00:00:02,506
<v Instructor>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,506 --> 00:00:03,746
and start with our to-do list.

3
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:06,278
The first thing we're gonna work on is step number one,

4
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:09,528
adding a "Delete" link on our JSP page.

5
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:18,768
So let's go ahead and move into Eclipse.

6
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,302
What I want to do is actually open up that file

7
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:22,885 line:15% 
"list-students.jsp"

8
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:30,424 line:15% 
and I want to add a "Delete" link on this JSP,

9
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:34,591 line:15% 
and we'll do small iterations on it to get us going.

10
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:41,229
So let's move down a bit in this table,

11
00:00:41,229 --> 00:00:42,838
the table rows, and we're gonna add this

12
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:45,133
right next to the "Update" link.

13
00:00:45,133 --> 00:00:46,293
We're actually gonna add it

14
00:00:46,293 --> 00:00:49,460
in the same cell as the "Update" link.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,756 line:15% 
So this is our normal table row, "firstName",

16
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,267 line:15% 
"lastName", "email", and right now we have "Update" link.

17
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,610 line:15% 
We're gonna use that same cell for the "Update" link

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,314 line:15% 
and we're gonna add another link here for "Delete".

19
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,240 line:15% 
But just to get us started, I just want to put

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,431 line:15% 
just a plain-text version of "Delete" in here right now.

21
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:13,598 line:15% 
So I'll do a space with a vertical bar

22
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:19,156 line:15% 
and then I'll hit return, and then I'll just add

23
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:22,381 line:15% 
the word "Delete". I'll get into the link stuff

24
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,976 line:15% 
in a second, but I just want to make sure

25
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:26,093 line:15% 
that this thing lays out properly.

26
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:28,747 line:15% 
So I just want to keep it simple, just to get us started.

27
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:31,027 line:15% 
But the key here is that there is one cell,

28
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:34,522 line:15% 
we have our "Update" link already with a vertical bar,

29
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:37,535 line:15% 
and then the text "Delete".

30
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:39,580
So let's save this, and let's run it,

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,247 line:15% 
just to make sure we have our HTML in order.

32
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:48,795
All right, so this looks really good.

33
00:01:48,795 --> 00:01:51,482
So here's our "Action". We have "Update".

34
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:54,989
With a vertical bar, "Delete". So it's plain-text right now.

35
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,583
Don't worry about the link stuff, we'll cover that

36
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,623
in a second, but at least I wanted to make sure that

37
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:01,706
we could lay it out properly in HTML.

38
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,778
So this looks good so far.

39
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:09,007
So let's go ahead and swing back

40
00:02:09,007 --> 00:02:11,424 line:15% 
into our "list-students.jsp".

41
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:15,740 line:15% 
And what I'd like to do here

42
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,657 line:15% 
is actually define a "deleteLink" for that URL.

43
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,950 line:15% 
So I want to do something very similar to what I did

44
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,474 line:15% 
for "Update", but I want to just copy that,

45
00:02:26,474 --> 00:02:29,207 line:15% 
and actually copy-paste it, and I'll set up

46
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:32,059 line:15% 
a similar link here for "Delete".

47
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:36,226 line:15% 
So let me just write a quick comment here to myself.

48
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:40,443 line:15% 
So I'll just highlight these lines, and I'll copy them,

49
00:02:40,443 --> 00:02:42,526 line:15% 
and I'll just paste them.

50
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,303
Okay, great. So they're pasted here.

51
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:47,693
Let me make some small mods.

52
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:51,480
So the variable name is not gonna be "tempLink" anymore.

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,573
I'll call this guy "deleteLink."

54
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,337
That's the name of the variable that we can use

55
00:02:55,337 --> 00:02:57,087
later on in our page.

56
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:03,149
And they're gonna send it to this servlet.

57
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:04,395
I want to change the command.

58
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,312
So instead of the "LOAD" command,

59
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:10,479
I want to give the command name "Delete" in all-caps.

60
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,771
All right, so that's basically it.

61
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:20,938
That's how we can define a link to delete a student.

62
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:29,624
All right, let me clean up some extra white space here.

63
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:31,933 line:15% 
Now let's move down to this "Delete" section here,

64
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:35,649 line:15% 
and this is where I'm gonna add or make use of that link.

65
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,899 line:15% 
I'll set up an href for it.

66
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:43,050 line:15% 
So here I'll say, "a href="

67
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:52,548 line:15% 
and here, I'll make use of the "${}"

68
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:54,798 line:15% 
and I'll say, "deleteLink".

69
00:03:55,758 --> 00:04:00,692 line:15% 
And I have my text, "Delete" and then "&lt;/a&gt;".

70
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,534 line:15% 
So that's the actual link.

71
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,691 line:15% 
Again, very similar to the "Update" link

72
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,691 line:15% 
but now we're using a "Delete" link.

73
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:10,166 line:15% 
All right, so let's save that.

74
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,498 line:15% 
Now let's test this out here and see how it works.

75
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:14,834
So I can simply go back to my browser

76
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:18,167
and I can simply just refresh this page.

77
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,903
All right, so I hit the "Refresh".

78
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:27,856
And whoo, yeah. Looking good here.

79
00:04:27,856 --> 00:04:31,013
So here's our "Action", and we have our "Delete" link.

80
00:04:31,013 --> 00:04:33,176
And if you hover over each one of those links there,

81
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:35,349
it has the embedded student ID.

82
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:37,247
But here, let me go ahead and just copy this link

83
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,478
and put it into a text editor, just so you can see it.

84
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,903
So we're calling our servlet,

85
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:47,002
and we're passing over "command=DELETE&amp;studentId=5"

86
00:04:47,002 --> 00:04:49,217
or depending on whatever student ID

87
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:51,069
that we're using at that time.

88
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:53,835
The actual value for "studentId" will vary,

89
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,082
depending on where we're at in the list.

90
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:58,175
So this looks good so far.

91
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:02,258
So we're in pretty good shape, pretty good shape.

92
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,454
Now, one thing though, is that when I hit "Delete",

93
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:07,119
it doesn't do anything right now.

94
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:11,069
But I'd like to add a feature to prompt the user

95
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,273 line:15% 
before we actually do some deleting work.

96
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:16,215 line:15% 
So I'll prompt them up front,

97
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,882 line:15% 
"Hey, are you sure?"

98
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:22,734 line:15% 
before you blow up everything.

99
00:05:22,734 --> 00:05:24,557 line:15% 
So we want to prompt the user.

100
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,196 line:15% 
And we're gonna make use of some JavaScript to do that.

101
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,934 line:15% 
Ooh, JavaScript.

102
00:05:28,934 --> 00:05:31,491 line:15% 
Now, full disclosure: I'm not a JavaScript expert.

103
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:34,175 line:15% 
I know just enough JavaScript to get me by.

104
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:37,658 line:15% 
I like to copy a lot of JavaScript off the web.

105
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:40,425
But here, we're just gonna use JavaScript

106
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:44,592
to just prompt the user if they want to proceed or not.

107
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:51,165
So here I'll just make use of "confirm".

108
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:53,433
Basically I'll throw up a little dialog box and I'll say,

109
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,963
"Are you sure you want to delete this student?"

110
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:59,348 line:15% 
Now, what we have here in blue inside of the quotes here,

111
00:05:59,348 --> 00:06:03,515 line:15% 
inside of the double quotes, this is all JavaScript code.

112
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:10,076 line:15% 
We'll prompt the user, and if they hit "cancel",

113
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,716 line:15% 
then we simply do "return false".

114
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:13,742 line:15% 
If they hit "OK", then we'll actually process

115
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:16,325
and go to the actual href link.

116
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:22,808
So that's the idea of making use of JavaScript

117
00:06:22,808 --> 00:06:24,975
in this "onclick" handler.

118
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:30,242
So this is kind of exciting, we're actually making use

119
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:33,284
of JavaScript integrated with some jsp technology.

120
00:06:33,284 --> 00:06:36,367
This is actually really, really cool.

121
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:39,118
All right, so there we go.

122
00:06:39,118 --> 00:06:41,192
So that's in place, save that.

123
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,451
Let's go back over to our browser.

124
00:06:43,451 --> 00:06:44,779
And actually, what I'm gonna do here is,

125
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:48,774
I'm actually gonna copy the URL, and I'll move it

126
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:51,524
into a real browser like Firefox.

127
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,889
And then I'll click "Delete", and it says,

128
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,204
"Are you sure you want to delete this student?"

129
00:07:00,204 --> 00:07:02,741
And you can hit "OK" or "Cancel".

130
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:04,695
Again, doesn't really do anything on the back end yet,

131
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:06,440
'cause we haven't written a servlet code,

132
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,107
but we'll get there in a second.

133
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,310
All right, so that's kind of the basics here for step one.

134
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,906
So we went through the process

135
00:07:16,906 --> 00:07:19,931
of actually adding a "Delete" link to our jsp.

136
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:22,346
In the following videos, we'll get into the servlet

137
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:25,661
and database code for actually performing the JDBC work

138
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:30,088
and actually deleting the user from the database.

139
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:33,838
We'll cover that next, so I'll see you there.
