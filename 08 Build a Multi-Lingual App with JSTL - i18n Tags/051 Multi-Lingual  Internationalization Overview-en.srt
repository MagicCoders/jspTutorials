00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,261
<v Chad>Hey, in this video we're gonna cover</v>

2
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:05,213
JSTL Internationalization.

3
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:08,117
So first off, what is internationalization?

4
00:00:08,117 --> 00:00:11,253
Well, it's basically the process of designing an application

5
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:13,917
where you can adapt it to different languages

6
00:00:13,917 --> 00:00:17,173
without having to make changes to your source code,

7
00:00:17,173 --> 00:00:19,357
and I think you've seen some of these before.

8
00:00:19,357 --> 00:00:22,277
So if you visit any travel site or hotel site,

9
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:25,205
they'll give you the option to view their information

10
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:26,685
in a different language.

11
00:00:26,685 --> 00:00:28,853
So here's one of my favorite hotels in India,

12
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:30,973
the JW Marriott in Bangalore,

13
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:34,085
and up in the top right you have a link there

14
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,637
for the different flags of the different countries,

15
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,975
so you can choose that link

16
00:00:37,975 --> 00:00:41,269
and then it'll allow you to view this website,

17
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:43,397
this hotel website, in a different language.

18
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:45,814
So here we can choose German,

19
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,629
and now they'll show you the site in German,

20
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:52,525
so all the tags, and all the labels, and so forth,

21
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,293
they've dropped in the German equivalent,

22
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:55,541
so if you're speaking German,

23
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:58,373
you could easily go through and book a hotel here

24
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:01,109
using this information.

25
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,197
And likewise, if you're traveling from a different country,

26
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,653
say you're coming from Spain,

27
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:06,917
then you can just simply move down and say,

28
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:11,229
"Hey, I'd like to see the site in Spanish,"

29
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:12,133
and there you go.

30
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:15,533
So note how this is really easy, really cool.

31
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,613
The folks that built this site,

32
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:20,425
they simply set up internationalization up front,

33
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:21,893
and then they allowed the application

34
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:23,885
to just swap in a different language

35
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:26,635
for different values accordingly.

36
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:30,301
And in the following videos,

37
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:32,349
I'll show you how you can use JSP

38
00:01:32,349 --> 00:01:36,182
to actually internationalize your own website.

39
00:01:38,357 --> 00:01:41,189
All right, so the term internationalization

40
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,701
is frequently abbreviated as I18N,

41
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,805
and you may wonder, well why did they come up with that?

42
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,805
Well, there's 18 letters

43
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:53,978
between the first I and the last n in the word,

44
00:01:56,338 --> 00:01:59,275
so instead of having to write it out longhand every time,

45
00:01:59,275 --> 00:02:03,451
you'll simply see folks make use of the abbreviation I18N,

46
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:04,867
and I know it's really geeky,

47
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:07,891
but I just wanted to share that with you,

48
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,779
'cause you'll see it a lot

49
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,747
in some of the documentation and journals.

50
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:13,835
So how do you do internationalization?

51
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:17,444
Well basically, instead of hard-coding text and messages

52
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:18,796
in your application,

53
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:19,860
instead what you'll do

54
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,693
is you'll make use of labels and placeholders.

55
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:26,396
So for greeting the user,

56
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,647
you'll simply have a label for greeting.

57
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:30,267
To reference their first name and last name,

58
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:31,686
you'll use labels for that.

59
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:32,894
To give them a welcome message,

60
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:34,544
you'll have a label for that.

61
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:36,670
So it's simply just a placeholder,

62
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,134
and then you'll supply the appropriate values and data

63
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:41,334
to insert there,

64
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:44,966
based on the language that the user has selected.

65
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,510
Now what you'll have to do is

66
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,631
for each language you're site's gonna support,

67
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:51,726
you need to create translated versions of each label.

68
00:02:51,726 --> 00:02:54,070
So there's no magic here.

69
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,094
Java won't automatically create everything for you.

70
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,254
You'll have to create this special file

71
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:02,806
that will have the appropriate translations for a greeting,

72
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:05,534
or first name/last name, or the welcome message.

73
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,447
You'll have to create that file,

74
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:09,214
and I'll show you how to create that file

75
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:11,381
in the next set of videos.

76
00:03:14,422 --> 00:03:16,598
So again, instead of hard-coding the messages

77
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:17,646
in your application,

78
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:18,830
we make use of these labels,

79
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,678
basically placeholders for a locale,

80
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,454
and a locale is basically a combination

81
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,198
of a language and a region.

82
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:27,222
So there's a number of different locales.

83
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:31,062
So here we have the first locale, en_US,

84
00:03:31,062 --> 00:03:34,062
that's English that's based in the US,

85
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:37,750
en_GB, that's English based in the UK,

86
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,422
and there are differences between the two,

87
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:42,056
even though it's the same language,

88
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,456
depending on which country or region

89
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,160
that you're working with,

90
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,600
some things are different.

91
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,561
So as far as some of the differences here,

92
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:52,136
is formatting dates, numbers, and currency.

93
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:56,008
So in the US, when we display a date, short dates,

94
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:58,512
we simply use month, day, year,

95
00:03:58,512 --> 00:04:01,464
however in the United Kingdom or Great Britain,

96
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:05,864
when they make use of short date, it's day, month, year,

97
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:07,776
so it's really confusing.

98
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:10,919
So those are just some of the differences, formatting dates.

99
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,079
Also, formatting numbers,

100
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:14,136
depending on what delimiters you'll use there,

101
00:04:14,136 --> 00:04:15,552
and also formatting currency,

102
00:04:15,552 --> 00:04:18,432
as far as using the actual currency symbol

103
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:20,303
for that given area.

104
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,839
One caveat here on the currency.

105
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,494
Formatting the currency

106
00:04:24,494 --> 00:04:26,246
is only for giving the currency symbol,

107
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:29,039
like a dollar sign, or pound symbol, or euro symbol.

108
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:33,127
However, it will not do any currency conversion for you,

109
00:04:33,127 --> 00:04:35,567
so it won't automatically connect,

110
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,455
and get the currency exchange, and convert it for you,

111
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:41,336
it's simply displaying formatting data.

112
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:44,727
You'll still have to convert the currency in the background

113
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,367
with your own Java code.

114
00:04:46,367 --> 00:04:47,711
So just a heads-up there:

115
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:51,878
it's only for formatting and displaying information.

116
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,175
All right, so when it comes to internationalization,

117
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,862
JSTL has a collection of functions.

118
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:04,087
The first set of functions here is for setting the locale.

119
00:05:04,087 --> 00:05:06,590
The next set is for making use of message bundles

120
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,632
and setting up a message bundle.

121
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:10,190
And then finally they have a collection of tags

122
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,286
for number and date formatting,

123
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:14,999
and we'll actually cover all of these tags

124
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,307
as we go through the following videos.

125
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:20,042
I'll show you how to set up a multi-lingual application,

126
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:23,578
and then we'll also make use of number and date formattings,

127
00:05:23,578 --> 00:05:26,770
and so we'll provide some good coverage of these tags

128
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,266
in the following videos.

129
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:29,194
All right, so stay tuned,

130
00:05:29,194 --> 00:05:30,538
a lot of good things in store,

131
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,874
and I'll see you there.

132
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:32,707
Thanks.
