1
00:00:01,115 --> 00:00:02,625
<v Instructor>Hey, in this video, we're gonna cover</v>

2
00:00:02,625 --> 00:00:07,166
the JSTL Internationalization and formatting tags.

3
00:00:07,166 --> 00:00:08,191
The main objective here

4
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:11,425
is that we actually wanna apply internationalization,

5
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:15,792
so we actually wanna build a multi-lingual application.

6
00:00:15,792 --> 00:00:17,667
So again, we wanna build an app

7
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:19,558
where we can change to different languages

8
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:23,608
without having to modify the source code.

9
00:00:23,608 --> 00:00:26,208
Here's an example of the sample app we're gonna create.

10
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,233
We'll show the user the basic information

11
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,733
using English based in the US.

12
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:33,642
Then we'll give 'em a link where they can choose,

13
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:36,387
change the language to Spanish.

14
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:38,175
And then finally, we'll give 'em another link

15
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:41,350
where they change it to view the information in German.

16
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,475
I'll show you how to build all of these code

17
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:46,675
in this video, and also, the following video.

18
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:48,825
Basically, what we'll do is we'll cover the overview,

19
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:52,046
like the slides and the background on it in this video.

20
00:00:52,046 --> 00:00:54,300
The following video, we'll actually get our hands dirty

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,883
and write the code in Eclipse.

22
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:57,458
But don't worry, you'll see everything

23
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,625
on how it's all built out.

24
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,566
The big picture here is that we're gonna make use

25
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,733
of placeholders in our page.

26
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,125
Instead of hard coding the text,

27
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,325
we're gonna have placeholders,

28
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:11,050
one for greeting, first_name,

29
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,958
last_name, and welcome_message.

30
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,975
And depending on the language that we're using

31
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,108
or the locale that we're using,

32
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:19,692
we'll simply insert the appropriate data.

33
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:21,108
For example, if we're using Spanish,

34
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:23,908
we'll put in the Spanish greeting from Hola,

35
00:01:23,908 --> 00:01:26,633
the Spanish information for first_name, last_name,

36
00:01:26,633 --> 00:01:29,375
and the Spanish welcome_message of buenos dias.

37
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:32,950
And again, my rough interpretation there of Spanish,

38
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,349
but anyway, you get the idea,

39
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,508
and I'll show you how to pull all this together.

40
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,800
All right, and again,

41
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,250
you know how luv2code Chad Darby works.

42
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,113
I love to-do list, so the first thing we'll do

43
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:46,367
is create our resource files.

44
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:49,267
The second thing is creating our JSP page with labels.

45
00:01:49,267 --> 00:01:51,225
Step three is to update the JSP page

46
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:54,750
to change the locale based on user selection.

47
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,158
All right, so a lot of good things here.

48
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,325
Let's go ahead and dig in.

49
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:02,558
All right, so step one is creating the resource files.

50
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:03,391
What we have to do

51
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,700
is create translated versions of our labels.

52
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,575
So, you'll need to make use of a separate service,

53
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:13,092
like maybe Google Translate or hire a translator.

54
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,117
You basically have to give

55
00:02:14,117 --> 00:02:15,767
the translated versions of your labels.

56
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,000
Now, there's no magic here.

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,475
Java will not automatically translate your application.

58
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,642
You'll have to specify that translated information.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,333
All right, now, this information is all based on locales.

60
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:31,758
So, what's a locale?

61
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:33,283
A locale is basically a combination

62
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:36,283
of the language code and the country code.

63
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:37,650
It's more than just the language

64
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,692
because there could be differences for a language

65
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:42,183
depending on your country.

66
00:02:42,183 --> 00:02:44,808
For example, we have English based in US

67
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:47,000
and also English based in Great Britain.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,208
And there are differences between the two

69
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,441
as far as the vernacular

70
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:52,983
and also, differences between formatting dates,

71
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:54,775
time, and currency, and so on.

72
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,767
So, locale is what we'll be looking at.

73
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,325
So again, locale is the combination

74
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:01,158
of language code and country code.

75
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,150
All right, step one, creating the resource file.

76
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,700
When you create the resource file,

77
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,042
the file must follow a specific name naming convention here.

78
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:14,258
You give your project name,

79
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,150
underscore, a language code,

80
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,017
underscore, a country code, .properties.

81
00:03:19,017 --> 00:03:20,667
Here are some examples.

82
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,892
I have mylabels_es, for Spanish,

83
00:03:23,892 --> 00:03:27,425
_ES, caps, for Spain, .properties.

84
00:03:27,425 --> 00:03:30,200
So again, language code, country code.

85
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,817
A similar thing here for German, for Germany,

86
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:35,067
and English, Great Britain.

87
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,592
All right, so that's the file name.

88
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:39,425
Now, a little bit more here

89
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:41,217
on the country codes and language codes.

90
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,500
They're all based on ISO Standards,

91
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,642
so the language codes are based on ISO Standard 639-1.

92
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:50,325
It's basically the two-letter language code.

93
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:54,325
The country codes are also based on ISO Standard 3166-2,

94
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:56,767
which again is a two-letter country code.

95
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:59,591
You can follow those links there for details on codes

96
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:02,841
for your specific country and language.

97
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:07,150
All right, now, let's get down to the nitty-gritty.

98
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,650
Here's the file for the locale Spanish - Spain.

99
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,067
I need to create my file mylabels_es, for Spanish,

100
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,400
_ES, for Spain, .properties.

101
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,525
And in this file,

102
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,550
I need to give the appropriate information.

103
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,091
For label.greeting, I'll say Hola.

104
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:27,650
label.firstname, I have information there

105
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,850
A similar thing for label.lastname.

106
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,533
And finally, label.welcome for buenos dias, so on.

107
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:34,522
So, that's the idea.

108
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:37,233
Now, again, you need to manually create these files

109
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,342
by using either Google Translate or hiring a translator

110
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:44,200
to help you out with building up the properties file.

111
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,758
But again, you have to provide this data

112
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,425
for the Java system.

113
00:04:50,017 --> 00:04:50,867
All right, so now we have

114
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:53,017
the label information taken care of,

115
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:55,558
now we need to use these labels in our JSP.

116
00:04:55,558 --> 00:04:57,175
This is step two.

117
00:04:57,175 --> 00:04:59,142
Basically, what we do is we make use

118
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:01,800
of the JSTL Tag Library format

119
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,650
and say fmt:message, and then we give the key,

120
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,025
and we simply give our label name.

121
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:09,067
That label name is from the properties file.

122
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,800
So, Label.greeting,

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,317
actually, JSP will insert that Label.greeting there

124
00:05:13,317 --> 00:05:15,017
for that given locale.

125
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,942
Label.firstname, it will insert the information,

126
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,833
Label.lastname, and Label.welcome.

127
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,808
So again, based on the locale that the user selected,

128
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:28,183
JSP will actually substitute that value right there.

129
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:29,358
So, you'll get the information

130
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:31,692
for English or Spanish or German

131
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:35,317
or whatever country or locale that you selected

132
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:37,067
for your application.

133
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,600
All right, so that's the resource file,

134
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,125
so now, the next step, step three,

135
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,033
updating the JSP page to change the locale

136
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,942
based on the user selection.

137
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,225
Basically, what we'll do on our app

138
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:51,375
is that we'll put links at the top of the page

139
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,258
where the user can choose their language or locale.

140
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:56,300
And basically, they'll select these links

141
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,100
and we'll simply just send it back as a link to ourself

142
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,575
and we'll pass the locale as a parameter.

143
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:05,908
And then we can read that param

144
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,417
and then load the appropriate resource file

145
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,742
or resource bundle.

146
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:11,192
So, that's basically how we'll do it.

147
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:12,192
This is kind of plain vanilla.

148
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:15,091
We could dress it up, flag, images, and so on,

149
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:18,792
but here, just get the point so far.

150
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:22,758
The coding for these links here, we just set up an href,

151
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:26,050
so we have anchor href, we point to our JSP page,

152
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,158
and then in red, we say theLocale equals,

153
00:06:29,158 --> 00:06:32,600
and then we give that locale, en_US

154
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,833
or ES for Spanish, or DE for German,

155
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,775
and that's basically it.

156
00:06:37,775 --> 00:06:38,708
That sets up a link.

157
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:39,541
Now, on the next slide,

158
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,284
I'll show you how to pull it all together

159
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:45,451
but this part just sets up the links at the top of our page.

160
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,458
All right, so we have the links coming in.

161
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:53,833
So now, in this page, we're basically gonna read those links

162
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:57,434
and set the values accordingly for the locale.

163
00:06:57,434 --> 00:07:01,133
We can access the link values that were set,

164
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:05,492
or selected by the user, by using param.theLocale.

165
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:08,333
On the second line here, we check the value

166
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:12,308
to see if it's not empty, then we'll use param.theLocale,

167
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,625
and that came from that href link.

168
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:18,067
Now, in the event that that value is empty or not available,

169
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:20,658
then our else clause here will make use

170
00:07:20,658 --> 00:07:23,158
of pageContext.request.locale.

171
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:27,658
So, every HTTP web request that comes in,

172
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:30,933
the web browser will send the default locale

173
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,267
based on the user's operating system.

174
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:36,233
So, the bottom line here is that we'll be able to find out

175
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:38,817
what locale the user wants to use

176
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,458
and we'll set that as a variable.

177
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,041
So, c:set var="theLocale",

178
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:45,534
we'll have a reference to that

179
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:48,475
and we'll keep it in our session for later use.

180
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:52,542
Now, the next set of lines here, fmt:setLocale,

181
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,317
we actually set the locale and we give it a value.

182
00:07:55,317 --> 00:07:57,625
So normally, folks would hard code it

183
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,125
with a given locale like en_US

184
00:08:02,092 --> 00:08:04,067
but here, we're using it based on that variable

185
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,275
that we set up in the previous line.

186
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:09,408
And then finally, we tell JSP page

187
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:11,350
which resource bundle to use.

188
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,517
So here, we say setBundle,

189
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:15,308
we give the basename,

190
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:17,500
so that means the base name of the file,

191
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,767
and then JSP will append the appropriate locale

192
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,250
and load the appropriate properties files

193
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,333
that you can use in this page,

194
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,825
and that's all handled here.

195
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:29,167
So, that's a little magic there

196
00:08:29,167 --> 00:08:31,992
as far as reading that properties file

197
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:35,733
based on the appropriate locale that the user selected.

198
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:38,150
All right, good stuff so far.

199
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,942
All right, so, what I wanted to do here

200
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,442
is I want to give you an overview

201
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:46,167
of how that development process work out.

202
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,442
What we're gonna do is move into the next video

203
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,200
and we'll actually get our hands dirty

204
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,608
and I'll show you how to build all of this from scratch

205
00:08:52,608 --> 00:08:55,300
in the Eclipse IDE, but I at least wanted to give you

206
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,483
some of the theories and the concepts first

207
00:08:57,483 --> 00:08:58,316
and we can actually go through

208
00:08:58,316 --> 00:09:02,483
and apply it in the next video, so I'll see you there.
