1
00:00:01,194 --> 00:00:02,399
<v Instructor>Alright, so we're making some good progress</v>

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,700
here, so in step three, we're gonna update the JSP page

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,272
to change the Locale based on user selection,

4
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:10,789
so basically, we're gonna give them links

5
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:12,898
at the top of the page, where they can choose

6
00:00:12,898 --> 00:00:14,667
English, Spanish or German,

7
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:18,739
and then will show the appropriate data, accordingly.

8
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:21,875
Alright, so let me give myself some white space, here,

9
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,284
and what I like to do right here,

10
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:27,451
around line eight is go ahead and add some href links,

11
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:36,825
so I set up an anchor href=i18n, messages test.jsp,

12
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:42,246
and I usually use a question mark to pass over a parameter,

13
00:00:42,246 --> 00:00:46,413
and I have the Locale=en_US, so English based in the US.

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,690
This is basically just a link back to this same JSP page,

15
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,997
and a little later, we're gonna read that data

16
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:56,835
and process on it, accordingly,

17
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,605
but for now, we're just setting up the links,

18
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:00,296
so let me just copy this first link, here

19
00:01:00,296 --> 00:01:02,409
and just paste it about three times,

20
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,687
and then I go through and change it up for

21
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:05,860
the different languages here.

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,583
So, on the second item here, this is for Spanish,

23
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:12,988
so I'll do es underscore ES, in all caps,

24
00:01:12,988 --> 00:01:15,235
and for the description of the link text,

25
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:16,652
I'll say Spanish,

26
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,343
and in parens, I'll say ES for Espania, or Spain;

27
00:01:23,515 --> 00:01:27,015
I'll do a similar thing here, for Germany,

28
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:31,949
de underscore DE, so the language is German,

29
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:34,918
and the country is Germany, DE.

30
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:35,869
Again, using those language codes

31
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,563
from the previous lectures;

32
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:40,419
alright, so that's basically it, here for our links,

33
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:43,272
so on our JSP page, we'll have links along the top,

34
00:01:43,272 --> 00:01:45,955
where the user can select the link and change it

35
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:49,872
to a different locale, so this is good, so far.

36
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,630
Alright, so let's move up top and let's do some processing,

37
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,651
here, 'cause we need to change the locale

38
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:02,068
based on parameter input being passed in;

39
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,453
okay, great, so what I'm doing here,

40
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:24,304
is I'm setting up a variable, here called theLocale,

41
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:27,545
and this is a variable that I'm gonna use a little later;

42
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:30,790
the actual value for it, I make use of that param

43
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,864
being passed in theLocale,

44
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:35,386
so I check to see if the param is not empty;

45
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:38,465
if it's not empty, then I use that param.theLocale,

46
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:40,789
else, I make use of the locale that's passed in

47
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:43,122
via the pageContext.request,

48
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,547
and then, this locale variable that I'm setting up;

49
00:02:46,547 --> 00:02:49,460
I make the scope=session, so that's the basic piece, there,

50
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,482
so now we know at least what value that they're using,

51
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:54,829
or that they've selected for the locale,

52
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:57,554
and we have it set in this variable, called theLocale.

53
00:02:57,554 --> 00:02:59,984
So now, on line nine, I'll actually set theLocale

54
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:03,063
based on that information, and again, I use the dollar sign,

55
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:05,609
curly brace, the JSP expression language

56
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:08,266
to actually set theLocale, based on that param

57
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:10,933
that I just set up in line five.

58
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,563
And then the final thing I need to do here,

59
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:21,498
is actually set a reference to the bundles;

60
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:25,498
I need to tell it which bundle base name to use,

61
00:03:27,247 --> 00:03:30,659
so for the base name, I give the actual package name

62
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,076
of where the file is located,

63
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:41,258
so it's com luv2code jsp tagdemo i18n.resources,

64
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:42,658
and then the actual file name,

65
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,156
so the last entry there is the base file name, mylabels.

66
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:47,941
And remember, we have different versions of that

67
00:03:47,941 --> 00:03:52,642
mylabels file, for Spain, for Germany, and it's

68
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:55,317
a dot properties, and again, remember JSP

69
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:59,570
will handle appending the actual locale on there,

70
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,562
and also appending the name dot properties

71
00:04:01,562 --> 00:04:02,883
on there, accordingly.

72
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:06,883 line:15% 
So that's all kind of built into the JSP system,

73
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:11,909 line:15% 
so again, just highlighting, this is the actual package name

74
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:14,659 line:15% 
that we created a little earlier,

75
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:20,843 line:15% 
and then mylabels is the actual base name of the file,

76
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,900 line:15% 
and then you have the different variations of it

77
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,400 line:15% 
based off of that.

78
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:27,954 line:15% 
Alright, so this looks really good so far,

79
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:30,172 line:15% 
with setting up our bundle;

80
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:33,442 line:15% 
we can go ahead and save this file, and we can go ahead

81
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:34,692 line:15% 
and try it out.

82
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:42,977
Alright, so let's try it out, let's move to our file, here,

83
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:47,952
i18n messages test, messages test.jsp, right click,

84
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:51,702
choose Run As, and then choose Run on Server,

85
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:57,952
and we're up and running; I noticed one, small cosmetic

86
00:04:57,952 --> 00:05:00,475
thing here, that's kinda annoying me, here;

87
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:03,510
notice up top, we have our links, and then we have "Howdy"

88
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,814
on the same line.

89
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:06,264
I think I forgot to put in a line break or

90
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,671
a horizontal rule, so let me go back into this file, here,

91
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,999
and add that, so I'm gonna add an hr for horizontal rule,

92
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:17,166
so under my links, here on line 22, some whereabouts;

93
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,028
I'll hit Enter, on line 23, I'll enter an hr,

94
00:05:22,028 --> 00:05:23,634
just a horizontal rule, just to give us

95
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:26,547
a nice division of labor, here.

96
00:05:26,547 --> 00:05:29,518
So let's go ahead and save this file, and then I should

97
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:32,606
be able to go back to my JSP and just do a refresh on it

98
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,856
and see this new alignment;

99
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,809
so there's my file, just do a refresh on it,

100
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,643
and there we go, cool, alright, so that looks better.

101
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:46,337
So right now, we're looking at just the default locale,

102
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,385
here, that's coming through,

103
00:05:47,385 --> 00:05:49,533
so nothing was selected, so it'll default

104
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:53,361
to just using English; if I choose the link for Spanish,

105
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,692
note the locale being passed over, as the parameter

106
00:05:55,692 --> 00:05:59,859
is es_ES, so we'll see everything in Spanish, here;

107
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:04,003
as far as everything from our labels that are based

108
00:06:04,003 --> 00:06:06,512
in Spanish, and then we can move forward,

109
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:08,097
and we could do a similar thing, here,

110
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,261
by clicking on the link for Germany.

111
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:13,457
And again, now we're seeing the information in German,

112
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:16,005
so the nice thing to notice here, is that this

113
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:18,801
all happens in the background for you;

114
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:22,944
we did the work up-front of creating those translated

115
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:27,111
resource files, but now JSP will actually handle picking out

116
00:06:28,045 --> 00:06:30,671
the appropriate file and displaying

117
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:33,276
the information accordingly.

118
00:06:33,276 --> 00:06:35,682
Now, there's one, little thing I want to change, here;

119
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:39,288
I actually want to tell the user what locale

120
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,825
they're looking at, or what language they're looking at,

121
00:06:41,825 --> 00:06:43,989
'cause they may wonder "what language is that?"

122
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:46,423
So, let me move into this file; I'll enter an hr,

123
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:49,161
just a horizontal rule, and I'll just tell them

124
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,514
the selected locale, and then I'll make use of that variable

125
00:06:52,514 --> 00:06:54,896
that we set up earlier in our file, here.

126
00:06:54,896 --> 00:06:59,361
So theLocale$ curly brace, JSP expression language,

127
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:00,761
and that'll basically just display the value

128
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:04,366
of that variable that we set up a little earlier,

129
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:08,116
so I have this new code, here, it's in place;

130
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:12,960
I can go up and hit the Save button,

131
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,260
and now I can go back to my JSP page, and I can go through

132
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,953
and click on some of the links.

133
00:07:19,953 --> 00:07:23,176
So, English, note the new entry, here at the bottom,

134
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,093
Selected locale, en_US,

135
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:31,212
go for Spanish, again, the new entry here at the bottom,

136
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,724
and then finally, a similar thing for German.

137
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:38,033
So, cool, that's a nice little enhancement,

138
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:41,033
just to help us out, mainly a training exercise,

139
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,489
but a good thing to play around with,

140
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:45,689
so I think we're pretty much done with this

141
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:47,775
internationalization exercise, so we basically have

142
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:51,942
a multilingual app, using JSP and the JSTL tags, good job.
