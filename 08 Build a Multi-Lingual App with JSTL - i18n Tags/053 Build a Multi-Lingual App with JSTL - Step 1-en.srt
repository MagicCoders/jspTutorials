1
00:00:01,197 --> 00:00:03,363
<v ->Alright, so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:03,363 --> 00:00:04,952
and get our hands dirty.

3
00:00:04,952 --> 00:00:06,458
So the first thing we need to do is

4
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:10,625
create our resource files for the different locales.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,369
So in my tagdemo project, what I'll do is I'll move down

6
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:19,015
to the Java resources directory

7
00:00:19,015 --> 00:00:22,403
and basically what I wanna do here is create a new package.

8
00:00:22,403 --> 00:00:24,651
This is where I'll place my files.

9
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:27,584
So I'll just basically choose the existing package here

10
00:00:27,584 --> 00:00:31,751
and I'll do a right click and I'll say new, package.

11
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:45,238
Alright so they'll give me the package name to start with

12
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:46,914
and then I'll finish it up so

13
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:50,247
com.luv2code.jsp.tagdemo.i18n.resources.

14
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:58,634
So that's the package name that I wanna use for this demo.

15
00:00:58,634 --> 00:00:59,734
And once you're happy with that

16
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:03,484
you can go ahead and click the finish button.

17
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:07,586
Alright, great, so we have our new package now.

18
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:10,288
What I wanna do is actually create a new file

19
00:01:10,288 --> 00:01:12,455
in this package directory.

20
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,239
So I'll just simply do a right click,

21
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:20,607
I'll say new and I'll move down to other

22
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:21,961
because they don't show file here

23
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,878
so I'll just say other.

24
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:27,020
And then I'll choose, under general,

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,353
I'll choose file

26
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,945
and then I'll click the next button

27
00:01:32,945 --> 00:01:35,021
and now I can actually enter my file name.

28
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:36,447
So the file name I wanna use here is

29
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:38,114
mylabels.properties.

30
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:45,987
And once you're happy with that name

31
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:49,737
you can go ahead and click the finish button.

32
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:04,293
Okay great, so here's our file, mylabels.properties.

33
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,948
So what we wanna do here is simply enter the labels

34
00:02:15,948 --> 00:02:18,190
and give the appropriate values for the labels

35
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,273
in this file.

36
00:02:21,263 --> 00:02:24,156
So I'll say label.greeting, label.firstname,

37
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:27,422
label.lastname, and label.welcome.

38
00:02:27,422 --> 00:02:29,429
And again, you can choose any names you want here

39
00:02:29,429 --> 00:02:30,945
for these properties.

40
00:02:30,945 --> 00:02:35,112
Simply stay consistent throughout your application.

41
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:41,612
Alright, so these are the basic labels here,

42
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:44,260
I'll go ahead and save this.

43
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,803
Now, this is what we call the default resource file.

44
00:02:47,803 --> 00:02:51,589
Notice here, it's simply called mylabels.properites,

45
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:54,704
there's no reference to a specific locale.

46
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:57,945
So basically, this file will be used if we don't have

47
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:01,460
a locale file for a given language.

48
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,324
So if they come through with maybe French

49
00:03:04,324 --> 00:03:08,491
or Chinese or Japanese and we don't have a locale file

50
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:12,486
for that then it will simply use this default file.

51
00:03:12,486 --> 00:03:16,016
So in this case it will simply default to using English

52
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:17,433
for this example.

53
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:22,140
But that's basically it, so this is our default resource

54
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,807
file with all of our properties.

55
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:31,251
Alright, now let's go ahead and create some resource files

56
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,331
for some of the other languages.

57
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:36,387
And what I'll do here is I'll simply just copy this file,

58
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:39,054
do a right click and choose copy

59
00:03:40,795 --> 00:03:43,383
and then I'll simply do a right click and choose paste.

60
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:46,966
Just a very simple copy paste example here.

61
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:52,042
And now for the new file, this is gonna be for Spanish

62
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:56,616
so I'll say, "mylabels underscore es, lowercase,

63
00:03:56,616 --> 00:03:58,699
"underscore ES, in caps."

64
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:03,805
So again, once you're happy with this name

65
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,555
you can go ahead and click on OK.

66
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:10,172
And it's important that you get the file name extension

67
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:13,027
correct because it's gonna use that locale when it

68
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:16,146
actually looks up the actual properties file.

69
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:18,271
Alright, so this is the resource file for Spanish.

70
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:20,389
Alright now, it's just a copy paste from

71
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:21,899
the previous example.

72
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:25,175
What I'm gonna do here is put in the Spanish equivalent

73
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,503
here for the different entries.

74
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:30,420
So for greetings we'll say, "Hola,"

75
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,150
for first name, "Nombre de pila,"

76
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:41,049
last name, "Apellido," and again,

77
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,619
my Spanish is not that great.

78
00:04:43,619 --> 00:04:46,316
And then our welcome message, "Bienvenidos,"

79
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:49,649
and I'll go ahead and fill out the rest.

80
00:04:55,656 --> 00:04:57,618
Okay great, so this is the basic information here

81
00:04:57,618 --> 00:04:59,249
for our Spanish version.

82
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:01,298
So again, we have to manually enter this.

83
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:04,438
You can get this information via Google Translate

84
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,200
or talking to a friend who knows Spanish

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,385
and they can help you out

86
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:10,283
but you have to manually provide this data,

87
00:05:10,283 --> 00:05:12,116
there's no magic here.

88
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:15,414
Alright, so that's there, let's copy this file

89
00:05:15,414 --> 00:05:18,840
and let's paste it again because we're gonna set up

90
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,507
our file for German.

91
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:24,533
So I'll just do a copy paste here

92
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,814
and for the new name I'll say,

93
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:30,366
"mylabels underscore de, lowercase,

94
00:05:30,366 --> 00:05:34,019
"underscore DE, in all caps," so that's the locale.

95
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,979
So the language of German and the country of Germany.

96
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,903
And this is all based on those language codes

97
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:44,070
and country codes that we discussed in the previous videos.

98
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:47,604
Alright so let's look at the German file here.

99
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:49,925
So, again, it's a copy paste of our Spanish file,

100
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:51,891
we simply need to change this over to use

101
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:54,926
the appropriate German equivalents.

102
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:57,926
So here for greetings it's, "Hallo,"

103
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:01,586
first name is, "Vorname."

104
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:03,753
"Nachname," for last name,

105
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:09,241
and welcome, "Willkomen," and so on.

106
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,447
I know a little bit of German,

107
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:15,278
I studied it in high school but I forgot a lot of it so

108
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:16,435
(laughs)

109
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:20,180
I'm not gonna try and mess it up too bad.

110
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,347
So anyway, here's our resource file here for German.

111
00:06:25,644 --> 00:06:28,545
So again, note the file name, "mylabels underscore de,

112
00:06:28,545 --> 00:06:31,644
"underscore caps DE," and again, remember the locale

113
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:34,087
is the combination of the language code

114
00:06:34,087 --> 00:06:35,837
and the country code.

115
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:38,532
Okay great, so we have this lined up

116
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,782
and this looks good so far.

117
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:43,728
So right now we have three files,

118
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:48,303
we have our default file, that doesn't specify a locale,

119
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:52,053
we have a properties file here for Spanish,

120
00:06:52,053 --> 00:06:55,680
and then we have another properties file here for German.

121
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,492
So, this pretty much takes care of our step one

122
00:06:59,492 --> 00:07:02,078
as far as creating our resource files.

123
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:05,108
In the following videos, we'll actually make use

124
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:08,547
of these resource files in our JSP page.

125
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:10,263
And we'll cover that in the next video

126
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,306
but this takes care of step one as far as

127
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,099
creating our resource files.

128
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,766
So, good job so far.
