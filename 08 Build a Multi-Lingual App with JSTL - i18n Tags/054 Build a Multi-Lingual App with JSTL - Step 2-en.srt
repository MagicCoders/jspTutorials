1
00:00:01,267 --> 00:00:02,100
<v Narrator>Alright, so we have our</v>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,741
resource files taken care of.

3
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:07,227
The next step is creating the JSP page with labels.

4
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:09,238
So we're actually gonna use those labels

5
00:00:09,238 --> 00:00:12,405
that we defined in our resource files.

6
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,002
Alright, so lets move down to our web content directory.

7
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:20,501
What we wanna do here is create a new JSP file.

8
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:24,668
So I'll simply do a right click, I'll say new...file.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,787
And the name that I will give for the file

10
00:00:27,787 --> 00:00:31,787
I'll call it i18n-messages-test.JSP.

11
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:42,178
We can go ahead and click the finish button.

12
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:49,951
Alright, so imma go ahead and expand the window here.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,443
And i'll do my normal housekeeping work.

14
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:57,111
So first I'll drop in the taglib references

15
00:00:57,111 --> 00:01:00,611
for the core tags and the formatting tags.

16
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,785
Now let me just fix up line one for a second.

17
00:01:04,785 --> 00:01:06,624
Just throw the pre-fix down at the end.

18
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:08,736
I don't know I'd like to keep it consistent there.

19
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,424
Alright so those are our taglibs.

20
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,875
Now we'll do the normal html housekeeping.

21
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,208
Just html tags and our body.

22
00:01:19,137 --> 00:01:20,812
Alright, So now we can start coding

23
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:22,306
and so what we're gonna do is make use

24
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:25,052
of the formatting tag. And we're gonna reference

25
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:28,135
those labels from our resource files.

26
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:36,742
So here I make use of format message.

27
00:01:36,742 --> 00:01:38,985
I'll say key=label.greeting

28
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:42,024
So that's the actual entry or the properties file

29
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:44,477
that's in our resource file label.greeting

30
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,335
I'll just put a little line break here

31
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:47,526
to make things look pretty.

32
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:50,247
So that should give me the greeting

33
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:54,086
based on whatever resource that we're using at a given time

34
00:01:54,086 --> 00:01:56,279
and then I'll just repeat that process here.

35
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:59,112
Format message key label.firstname

36
00:02:05,397 --> 00:02:09,564
and then we'll just put a first name in here, John.

37
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:15,007
And again drop in another line break.

38
00:02:15,007 --> 00:02:16,454
And let me just copy this first name line

39
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:18,883
and do a similar thing here for last name.

40
00:02:18,883 --> 00:02:21,316
So I'll just change, instead of first name,

41
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:25,483
I'll say last name. And I'll just fix this name to be Doe.

42
00:02:27,826 --> 00:02:28,659
Alright, cool.

43
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:30,325
So that takes care of first name and last name.

44
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:33,109
Now our final thing is our welcome message.

45
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,550
So we'll say format message and then the

46
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,467
key=label.welcome.

47
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:49,155
Okay, great. So this looks really good so far.

48
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:51,797
So, What we did here was we made use

49
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,205
of that format message tag and we give our

50
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:57,313
reference to the key and they key is the actual property

51
00:02:57,313 --> 00:03:00,239
from our resource file that we're gonna reference.

52
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,969
So we use the key for our label.greeeting.

53
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:04,552
First name, last name, welcome.

54
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,449
And I can swing back over to that property

55
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,039
so I'll just verify that label.greeting

56
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,419
first name, last name, welcome.

57
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:15,506
And the key is, they each have to be consistent.

58
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,085
Make sure you use the same names

59
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:20,252
that you have in your properties file.

60
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,106
Alright, well this looks good so far.

61
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:24,859
This takes care of step two as far as

62
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:28,623
making use of our labels in our JSP page.

63
00:03:28,623 --> 00:03:31,057
On the following video, we'll actually show you

64
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:35,221
how to set the low cal based on the user selection.

65
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:38,888
But this is good work so far. So, great job.
