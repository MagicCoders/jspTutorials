1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:02,662
<v Narrator>In this video, we're gonna cover</v>

2
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:06,484
the sample architecture for our classroom project.

3
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,943
So, we'll cover the following topics.

4
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:12,542
We'll first do a fresh on the application features,

5
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,785
then we'll look at the big picture,

6
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:17,873
and then we'll discuss the Student Database Utility.

7
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:19,493
So, before we get into all the code,

8
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:21,035
I just wanted to make sure you understood

9
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:24,187
the big picture of the project.

10
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:26,174
Alright, so just as a refresher,

11
00:00:26,174 --> 00:00:29,133
we're building an app for this FooBar University,

12
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:32,169
so they can list the student and update

13
00:00:32,169 --> 00:00:34,308
and perform a delete on the student.

14
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:37,193
Those are the major CRUD functions.

15
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:39,245
So, looking at the big picture,

16
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:41,541
we're gonna have this web browser submit a request

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,705
to our Servlet controller.

18
00:00:43,705 --> 00:00:44,985
Our Servlet controller will make use

19
00:00:44,985 --> 00:00:48,669
of this helper class called a Student Database Utility,

20
00:00:48,669 --> 00:00:50,396
it'll talk to the DB.

21
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:52,569
The data will come back to the controller,

22
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:55,847
it'll forward it over to our JSP page, which is our view,

23
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,480
and then finally will send that view back to the browser.

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,741
So, this is kinda like our big picture for our application,

25
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:05,298
this is the big MVC architecture,

26
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,465
and we'll build this all out in the following videos.

27
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:14,631
Now, a little bit more about this Student Database Utility.

28
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:18,334
Its main purpose is for interfacing with the database

29
00:01:18,334 --> 00:01:20,283
using JDBC code.

30
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:23,643
So, this is actually a very common design pattern,

31
00:01:23,643 --> 00:01:27,814
it's called the Data Accessor Object design pattern, or DAO.

32
00:01:27,814 --> 00:01:29,692
So, if you join a new project team

33
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:32,691
or a new enterprise project at your company or job,

34
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:35,498
you're gonna hear other developers say DAO.

35
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:37,573
So, it's a very common design pattern,

36
00:01:37,573 --> 00:01:40,103
it's pretty much used by all of the major

37
00:01:40,103 --> 00:01:43,216
Java development teams and Java development shops,

38
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:45,501
and basically just isolates the JDBC code

39
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:48,065
to one class or collection of classes

40
00:01:48,065 --> 00:01:50,592
for you to use in your actual project.

41
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:53,710
And we'll build this out from scratch.

42
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,077
Alright, so anyways, wanted to give you

43
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:58,623
a head's up about the project, the big picture architecture.

44
00:01:58,623 --> 00:02:00,759
And then in the following videos,

45
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:01,931
we'll kinda break this down,

46
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:04,351
and we'll break it up into smaller sections.

47
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,162
We'll deep dive into each section,

48
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:09,091
and then we'll build it out from scratch.

49
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,178
Alright, a lot of good stuff.

50
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:12,147
I'm excited.

51
00:02:12,147 --> 00:02:13,888
Let's go ahead and start coding.

52
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:16,471
I'll see you in the next video.
