1
00:00:01,337 --> 00:00:02,967
<v Instructor>In this video, we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:02,967 --> 00:00:07,134
how to set up the database table for our classroom project.

3
00:00:08,421 --> 00:00:11,650
So what we'll do is we'll make use of two database scripts.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,119
The first script will create a user,

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:15,675
and the second script will set up

6
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:17,663
our student tracker database.

7
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:19,888
And in the following slides, I'll walk through

8
00:00:19,888 --> 00:00:21,971
each one of these scripts and show you

9
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:23,971
how they work in detail.

10
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:31,052
All right, so let's go and take a look at our first script.

11
00:00:31,052 --> 00:00:33,363
It's basically gonna create a new MySQL user

12
00:00:33,363 --> 00:00:34,788
for our application.

13
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:37,351
The user's gonna have a user ID of webstudent

14
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:40,310
and it'll also have a password of webstudent.

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,603
All right, so let's go ahead and move into

16
00:00:41,603 --> 00:00:44,446
MySQL Workbench and run this script.

17
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:47,569
So again, MySQL Workbench is basically just a GUI

18
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:52,014
for managing or administering your MySQL database.

19
00:00:52,014 --> 00:00:54,564
Let's go ahead and connect to the database.

20
00:00:54,564 --> 00:00:56,830
I'll use my root account, and I'll use the same

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,442
root password that I used when I installed a MySQL database.

22
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:02,876
Then I'll hit OK.

23
00:01:02,876 --> 00:01:05,157
And so at this point, I'm in MySQL Workbench.

24
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:07,176
Now what I'll do is, I'll actually open that file

25
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:09,938
that we just discussed, the 01-create-user.

26
00:01:09,938 --> 00:01:12,606
So I'll move up to the File menu, and I'll say

27
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,439
File, Open SQL Script,

28
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,652
and then I'll move over to

29
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:20,736
where I extracted the file, so in my case,

30
00:01:20,736 --> 00:01:22,852
I have this folder called my-java-training.

31
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:27,172
And then the extract of that jsp-servlet-jdbc-source-code.

32
00:01:27,172 --> 00:01:30,022
There's a folder here called sql-scripts.

33
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:31,938
The one script that I'm looking for here

34
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:34,105
is the 01-create-user.sql.

35
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:40,316
So again, this script basically creates a user.

36
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:43,424
Here we have CREATE USER 'webstudent'

37
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,737
IDENTIFIED BY 'webstudent'.

38
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,878
So we have the user ID and the password,

39
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:49,177
so that'll actually create a MySQL user for us.

40
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:52,049
And then on line three, we simply grant privileges,

41
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,330
so this allows the user to create more tables

42
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,919
and create more stored procedures and so on.

43
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:59,013
All right, so this looks good so far.

44
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,412
So now, to run this, I simply hit the little yellow

45
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,823
lightning bolt here, that will execute the SQL script.

46
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:08,254
At the bottom we'll have the little green check marks,

47
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,877
and that means, hey, everything's successful, we're happy.

48
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:14,555
So at this point, we have our user created.

49
00:02:14,555 --> 00:02:17,273
So that looks good so far.

50
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:19,390
Now, the next part here is making use of the

51
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,307
02-student-tracker.sql.

52
00:02:22,188 --> 00:02:24,615
What this is gonna do is it's gonna actually create

53
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:27,467
a new database table for us called student,

54
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:30,155
and then it's gonna load that database table

55
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,095
with some sample data.

56
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:35,928
So that's the main idea of this second script.

57
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,260
All right, so let's go ahead and move back

58
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,269
into SQL Workbench, and let's run this script.

59
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:42,397
So first, I have to open the file.

60
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:45,730
So I move back up to my File menu again,

61
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,791
and I'll say File, Open,

62
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:51,958
say Open SQL Script.

63
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,398
And in that same directory, I'm gonna look for that file,

64
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:56,315
02-student-tracker.sql,

65
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:02,739
so our same sql-scripts directory there.

66
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:03,971
All right, so that's the 02.

67
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:06,959
So let's go ahead and click Open.

68
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,873
All right, now, whoa.

69
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,426
There's a lot of stuff in this file.

70
00:03:10,426 --> 00:03:12,176
Don't let this file overwhelm you.

71
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:14,058
It's simply an output of a dump.

72
00:03:14,058 --> 00:03:16,001
But basically, what we're gonna do in this file

73
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:17,385
is two main things.

74
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:19,113
We're gonna create a table called student,

75
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:21,635
with the various columns, and then we'll go through

76
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,525
and we'll insert sample data.

77
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:25,629
So a lot of other stuff that's out there,

78
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:28,060
but the main items here, we create the table

79
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,977
and then we insert sample data into that table.

80
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:37,605
All right, so let's go ahead and run this one again.

81
00:03:37,605 --> 00:03:40,220
So again, we make use of that little yellow lightning bolt

82
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,762
there on the tool bar.

83
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:43,921
We click that button there.

84
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:46,092
And that'll execute, and again, we'll see our

85
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,080
little green check marks here at the bottom.

86
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,730
So that means that, hey, this script executed successfully.

87
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,758
Now, over on the left-hand side, we need to do

88
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:57,159
a right-click, and then we need to say Refresh All.

89
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,276
So this will basically refresh the list of schemas

90
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:02,181
or tables, and we'll see our new item here.

91
00:04:02,181 --> 00:04:04,686
So there we go, our web_student_tracker,

92
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:06,880
so that's our database that we've created.

93
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,307
And then inside of our database, we have a table

94
00:04:09,307 --> 00:04:12,795
called student, right, so there's our table right there.

95
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,073
And the student table has four columns.

96
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:18,873
It has id, first_name, last_name and email.

97
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:20,053
So that's good.

98
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:21,747
And then, we can actually query this table

99
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:24,384
and look at the data by doing a right-click and

100
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:26,134
choosing Select Rows.

101
00:04:28,928 --> 00:04:31,345
So once we do this then, here, there's our sample data.

102
00:04:31,345 --> 00:04:34,489
So we added just five sample students here,

103
00:04:34,489 --> 00:04:37,481
Mary, John, Ajay, Bill and Maxwell.

104
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:38,518
So this looks really good.

105
00:04:38,518 --> 00:04:42,093
So we have our test user created.

106
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:44,307
We have our database table created,

107
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:46,497
and we've loaded some sample data.

108
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:48,786
So we're in really, really good shape now.

109
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:50,296
And in the following videos, we'll make use of

110
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:51,377
this database.

111
00:04:51,377 --> 00:04:53,044
So, good job so far.
