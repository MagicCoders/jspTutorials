1
00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:02,026
<v Instructor>Hey, in this video we're gonna go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:04,387 line:15% 
and test out our Database connection.

3
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:05,587 line:15% 
So, the first thing we need to do is

4
00:00:05,587 --> 00:00:08,506 line:15% 
start off by creating a new project.

5
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:10,048 line:15% 
So, I'll go to the File menu

6
00:00:10,048 --> 00:00:13,215 line:15% 
and I'll say New, Dynamic Web Project.

7
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:19,089 line:15% 
And the name that we'll give for this project,

8
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:21,922 line:15% 
we'll call it web-student-tracker.

9
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,788 line:15% 
We'll keep all the other defaults for the project,

10
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:34,871
and we'll click on the Finish button.

11
00:00:37,277 --> 00:00:38,656
Alright, great, so Eclipse is gonna

12
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,035
create a new project for us

13
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:42,791
and it's gonna appear right here in the top left-hand.

14
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,215
So, we have this new project called web-student-tracker.

15
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,515
Which is great, so it's just a shell of a project.

16
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,426
There's not much there right now.

17
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:52,921
We need to go ahead and add some new information to it.

18
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:53,839
So, the first thing I want to do is

19
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:56,318
move into this WebContent directory,

20
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:58,094 line:15% 
because our first order of business is

21
00:00:58,094 --> 00:01:01,464 line:15% 
to copy over the JDBC JAR file.

22
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:03,772 line:15% 
So, this JDBC JAR file for MySQL

23
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,189 line:15% 
will allow us to connect to the Database.

24
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:09,869 line:15% 
And what I'll do is

25
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,020 line:15% 
I'll actually move back to those starter files

26
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,560 line:15% 
that we had earlier in that download.

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,234
So, remember we had our download,

28
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:20,276
my stuff is in my-java-training.

29
00:01:20,276 --> 00:01:22,472
Here is the extracted folders here

30
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:25,842
for jsp-servlet-jdbc-source-code.

31
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:27,784
I'm gonna move down to this folder here

32
00:01:27,784 --> 00:01:31,662
called web-student-tracker-starter-files.

33
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:35,558
And I'm gonna move into the WEB-INF directory

34
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:37,465
and I'll move into the lib,

35
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,721
and there should be a file in here

36
00:01:38,721 --> 00:01:41,054
called mysql-connector-java,

37
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:43,351
a version number, .jar.

38
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:45,462
So, that's our JDBC JAR file.

39
00:01:45,462 --> 00:01:47,411
So, I simply wanna copy this file.

40
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:51,328
So, I'll do a Right-Click and I'll choose Copy.

41
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,678
Okay, great, so I have this file copied.

42
00:01:58,678 --> 00:02:00,876
Well, now let me move back over to Eclipse.

43
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:04,863
Let's click on the WEB-INF/lib directory in my project,

44
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:05,995
and then I'll click Paste.

45
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,855
So, again, inside of Eclipse,

46
00:02:07,855 --> 00:02:11,170
WEB-INF/lib, click on Paste.

47
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,283
And this should paste this new JAR file here,

48
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:15,311
so expand the folder and there it is, cool.

49
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:17,378
So, our new JAR file is part of our project now,

50
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:18,795
so this is great.

51
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,588
Alright, so now that I have the JAR file over here,

52
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:29,592
now what I'd wanna do is

53
00:02:29,592 --> 00:02:32,156
copy over the connection pool configs.

54
00:02:32,156 --> 00:02:34,664
So, I'll move back to my starter-files again,

55
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:36,608
and I'll move into this directory here

56
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:39,025
called META-INF, context.xml.

57
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:42,163
So, this context.xml, again, remember

58
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:46,907
it has our connection pool configuration information.

59
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:48,856
So, I'll go ahead and select this file, again,

60
00:02:48,856 --> 00:02:51,856
do a Right-Click, we'll choose Copy.

61
00:02:56,278 --> 00:02:59,161
And then once again I'll move back over to Eclipse,

62
00:02:59,161 --> 00:02:59,994
I'll move into

63
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:03,302
the WebContent/META-INF directory in my project,

64
00:03:03,302 --> 00:03:06,552
I'll Right-Click and I'll choose Paste.

65
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:14,496
Okay, awesome, so that's our context.xml file.

66
00:03:14,496 --> 00:03:15,672
And so, I'll just Double-Click this file.

67
00:03:15,672 --> 00:03:17,987
Just as a quick refresher here,

68
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:20,172
this has our Database connection information.

69
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,255
So, it gives us the name,

70
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:25,036
the driverClassName and url,

71
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:25,929
so on and so forth.

72
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,676
So, this is all set up and

73
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:29,676
things look okay so far.

74
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,857
Alright, so I'll go ahead and close this file.

75
00:03:34,857 --> 00:03:36,929
So, now what I wanna do is actually

76
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,606
go ahead and get ready to write some code here.

77
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:43,076 line:15% 
So, the first thing I'm gonna do is create a package.

78
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:46,195 line:15% 
So, I'm gonna create a new package for my source code.

79
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:49,307 line:15% 
So, I'll move up to the Java Resources folder here

80
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,890 line:15% 
and I'll expand it.

81
00:03:53,124 --> 00:03:55,897 line:15% 
And I'll select the src folder here,

82
00:03:55,897 --> 00:03:58,573
and I'll just Right-Click and I'll say New

83
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,675
and I'll select New Java Package.

84
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,008
So, New Package.

85
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:06,723
So, this is a new package

86
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:08,876
where we're gonna place our source code.

87
00:04:08,876 --> 00:04:10,998 line:15% 
So, the name for the package, I'll call it

88
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:12,831 line:15% 
com.luv2code.web.jdbc.

89
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:17,181 line:15% 
So, that's our package name.

90
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:18,395 line:15% 
And once we're happy with that,

91
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:22,312 line:15% 
we can go ahead and click on the Finish button.

92
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:26,108
Okay, excellent, so we have this new package.

93
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:28,784
Now what I wanna do is create a new Servlet.

94
00:04:28,784 --> 00:04:31,384
So, this is a test Servlet that we're gonna create

95
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:33,737
that's gonna test our Database connection.

96
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:37,154
So, I'll say New and I'll choose Servlet.

97
00:04:41,988 --> 00:04:43,244
Alright, so here's the Servlet.

98
00:04:43,244 --> 00:04:44,768
So, the actual Class name I'll give,

99
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:46,717
I'll call it TestServlet.

100
00:04:46,717 --> 00:04:49,274
Very simple, very straightforward.

101
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:53,212
And once you're happy here, click the Finish button.

102
00:04:53,212 --> 00:04:56,373
Or actually, sorry, click the Next button.

103
00:04:56,373 --> 00:04:59,540
We'll accept the default URL mappings here.

104
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,342
We'll click Next one more time.

105
00:05:02,342 --> 00:05:04,779 line:15% 
And then on this dialog here,

106
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,282 line:15% 
we can uncheck some items.

107
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:08,346 line:15% 
So, uncheck the constructor,

108
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:10,252 line:15% 
and uncheck doPost.

109
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:12,326 line:15% 
So, your screen should look very similar to mine.

110
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:14,633 line:15% 
So, the one thing for Inherited,

111
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,173 line:15% 
and the one thing for doGet.

112
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:17,878 line:15% 
And everything else is unchecked.

113
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:21,795 line:15% 
And here, you can go ahead and click on Finish.

114
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,655
Alright, great, so now we have this very basic Servlet that

115
00:05:27,655 --> 00:05:29,263
Eclipse created for us.

116
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:32,495
So, this is kinda our initial start, our initial layout.

117
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:34,474
And what we'll do here is we will go ahead and

118
00:05:34,474 --> 00:05:38,641
add some code here to test out our Database connection.

119
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,357
So, the first thing I need to do is I need to

120
00:05:42,357 --> 00:05:44,180
get a reference to the connection pool.

121
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,292
So, remember earlier I said that

122
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:49,138
we can make use of a Java EE feature where

123
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:52,550
the Java app Server, or Tomcat,

124
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,962
will actually inject the connection pool for us.

125
00:05:55,962 --> 00:05:57,304
And so I'll show you how to do this.

126
00:05:57,304 --> 00:06:00,175
So, we make use of this special annotation here

127
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,592
called @Resource.

128
00:06:02,437 --> 00:06:05,681
So, we're gonna inject a resource, and we specify the name.

129
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:09,583
So, here we give name of jdbc/web_student_tracker.

130
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:13,343
And that's the same name we used in our context config file.

131
00:06:13,343 --> 00:06:15,891
And now I give a field here, our data members,

132
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,715
I say private DataSource,

133
00:06:17,715 --> 00:06:19,219
and then I'll just call it dataSource.

134
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:20,718
So, that's the actual handle

135
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:23,031
or reference to our connection pool.

136
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:25,589
Now, I'll go ahead and clean up some of the Imports here,

137
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:26,930
fix some of the errors, and so I'll

138
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,458
Import on javax.annotation for Resource,

139
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:32,732
select that option.

140
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,990
And then I'll do a similar thingy here for our DataSource.

141
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,443
And be careful with DataSource.

142
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:40,220
Make sure you Import javax.sql.DataSource.

143
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,476
There's a number of different ones out there,

144
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:42,770
make sure you get the right one,

145
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:45,196
javax.sql.DataSource.

146
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,539 line:15% 
Alright, great, now this name here for the Resource,

147
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,978 line:15% 
this is the exact same name as defined in our context.xml.

148
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,658 line:15% 
So, jdbc/web_student_tracker,

149
00:06:55,658 --> 00:06:57,278 line:15% 
the exact same name.

150
00:06:57,278 --> 00:06:59,348 line:15% 
You have to make sure these names match up

151
00:06:59,348 --> 00:07:02,347
for Tomcat to give you the correct connection pool.

152
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:05,473
Alright, so we have all the connection pool stuff set up.

153
00:07:05,473 --> 00:07:07,330
Let's go ahead and move into our doGet Method now.

154
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,382
Let's get ready to write some real code.

155
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:12,351
So, I'll give me some white space here

156
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:14,702
to kinda stretch out a bit.

157
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,649
And as you know, I always like to just

158
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,133
start off with writing some comments

159
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:21,883
as far as what this code's gonna actually do.

160
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:27,291
So, the first step is setting up the printwriter.

161
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,374
And then the second step is

162
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:32,457
getting a connection to the Database.

163
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:38,216
And then we go through and we create a SQL statement.

164
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,066
And then we go ahead and execute that SQL statement.

165
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:48,721
And then finally we process the result set.

166
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,027
So that's kinda the big idea,

167
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:56,451
the game plan for this doGet Method.

168
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:57,506
And then we'll cut the code

169
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:59,611
and we'll write all the code from scratch

170
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,861
on how this part works out.

171
00:08:04,866 --> 00:08:07,702
Alright, so let's go ahead and dive into step one,

172
00:08:07,702 --> 00:08:09,572
setting up the printwriter.

173
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,249
So again, this PrintWriter out is simply what we use

174
00:08:12,249 --> 00:08:13,793
to send data back to the browser.

175
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,210
So, I say response.getWriter,

176
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:19,225
so that's my out object.

177
00:08:19,225 --> 00:08:23,203
And then I also, I need to fix up the Imports here,

178
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,870
java.io.PrintWriter.

179
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:29,578
And then I'll also set the content type on this response,

180
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:33,745
so setContentType, and this will simply be text/plain.

181
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,092
'Cause right now I'm not really doing any HTML stuff,

182
00:08:40,092 --> 00:08:43,509
I'm just keeping it simple for right now.

183
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:45,600
Alright, so step two is

184
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,062
getting a connection to the Database.

185
00:08:47,062 --> 00:08:50,145
So, I'll set up some SQL objects here

186
00:08:51,521 --> 00:08:52,621
and I'll set them to null

187
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:53,839
and then I'll actually get a connection.

188
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,802
So, I'll set up myConn = null,

189
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,383
I'll set up a myStmt,

190
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:00,414
and I'll also set up a ResultSet.

191
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,247
But right now it's null,

192
00:09:01,247 --> 00:09:03,219
we haven't really assigned it to anything yet.

193
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:06,636
We'll assign it in those following steps.

194
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,356
And I'll go ahead and fix up the Imports.

195
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:11,189
And here I'll show you

196
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:13,306
an Eclipse trick on fixing the Imports.

197
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:15,171
They have this feature called Organize Imports.

198
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:16,754
So, I can go to Source,

199
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:19,069
and then I can choose Organize Imports.

200
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,452
And basically, Eclipse will go out

201
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:23,210
and try and resolve all the Imports for you,

202
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,794
and then it'll also ask you some questions.

203
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:28,485
So for here, for Statement, I say java.sql.Statement.

204
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:31,933
For Connection, java.sql.Connection, and hit Finish.

205
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:33,191
And then Eclipse will actually fix

206
00:09:33,191 --> 00:09:34,652
all those Imports for you.

207
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:35,584
So, now we're good to go.

208
00:09:35,584 --> 00:09:38,025
That's just a little Eclipse trick for you

209
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:40,192
that you can use later on.

210
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:42,882
Alright, now let's go ahead

211
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,638
and put this code inside of a try catch block.

212
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,991
So, try and then Exception,

213
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:50,551
and then I'll just say exc.printStackTrace.

214
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,051
This is kinda just

215
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:56,076
real quick and dirty for right now.

216
00:09:56,076 --> 00:09:58,270
We'll get into all the fancy stuff in later videos,

217
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,365
but for now we just wanna make sure

218
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:03,448
that we can get a valid connection to a Database.

219
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:09,765
So, here I set up myConn = dataSource.getConnection(),

220
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:12,311
so I'm basically getting a connection to the Database,

221
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:13,765
and I'm actually getting that connection

222
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:15,098
from the connection pool.

223
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:19,265
Remember dataSource is the same thing as connection pool.

224
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,469
I'll just set up a little SQL statement here,

225
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,302
select * from student.

226
00:10:26,229 --> 00:10:30,396
And I'll say myStmt = myConn.createStatement().

227
00:10:32,268 --> 00:10:34,059
Alright, so now let's go ahead and execute that Query.

228
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:36,498
So, here I'll say myStmt.executeQuery,

229
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:38,120
I pass in the sql.

230
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,493
It'll return a ResultSet, so I assign it to myRs.

231
00:10:41,493 --> 00:10:43,082
And remember those variables were defined

232
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:45,476
a little earlier in this code.

233
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:47,984
Now I simply need to process the ResultSet.

234
00:10:47,984 --> 00:10:50,490
So, here I'll say while myRs.next(),

235
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,084
so while I have more rows to process,

236
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:56,088
then I'll start peeling off or accessing some of that data.

237
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:59,016
So, I'll simply get the email address for the students.

238
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,490
I'll say myRs.getString("email")

239
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,891
and assign it to a variable, alright?

240
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:07,258
And then I simply say an out.println(email).

241
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:09,778
So, this out.println will actually send the data

242
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:11,935
back to the browser.

243
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:14,332
Not to the standard out, but actually back to the browser.

244
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:17,378
So, we'll see a very simple page in the browser

245
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:19,776
that'll simply loop through each one of the emails

246
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,566
and simply print them out.

247
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:25,625
On line 55 where we say myRs.getString("email"),

248
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:29,345
that's simply getting the email from that given column name.

249
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:33,024
So that's the basic idea here for doing the Database work.

250
00:11:33,024 --> 00:11:35,502
So, we get the connection, we create a statement,

251
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:37,042
we execute the SQL Query,

252
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:38,868
and then finally process the ResultSet.

253
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:42,868
So, that's the real brains here of this Servlet.

254
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:51,728
Well, alright, so let's go ahead and test this thing out.

255
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:57,916
So, what I'll do over on the left-hand side is

256
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,270
I'll kinda expand this window,

257
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,062
select this TestServlet,

258
00:12:02,062 --> 00:12:04,705
and then I'll do a Right-Click

259
00:12:04,705 --> 00:12:06,622
and I'll choose Run As,

260
00:12:07,711 --> 00:12:09,961
and I'll say Run on Server.

261
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,880
And so it'll prompt us which Server to run on,

262
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,417
I'll just choose the Tomcat 8,

263
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,477
I'll say always use this server,

264
00:12:17,477 --> 00:12:18,894
I'll click Next,

265
00:12:18,894 --> 00:12:20,515
and then I can just hit Finish.

266
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:22,424
And Tomcat'll start up,

267
00:12:22,424 --> 00:12:23,769
and then once Tomcat's running,

268
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:25,189
it'll show you the output here.

269
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:26,652
Wow, this looks pretty good.

270
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:30,065
So, these are the email addresses for the people,

271
00:12:30,065 --> 00:12:32,378
or the students that we have in the Database.

272
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,975
So, we're actually connecting to the Database,

273
00:12:34,975 --> 00:12:37,937
doing a Query, getting that ResultSet,

274
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:41,181
and displaying the results right here in the browser.

275
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:43,213
Now, don't worry, this is kinda very crude,

276
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,882
very ugly right now.

277
00:12:44,882 --> 00:12:48,748
We're simply validating that we can connect to the Database.

278
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:50,903
Later in the videos we'll actually make this pretty,

279
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,768
we'll make use of HTML tables,

280
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:54,628
we'll put in cascading style sheets,

281
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:59,283
and we'll just make it look lovely, so don't worry.

282
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:03,219
So, let's go ahead and switch over to our MySQL tool,

283
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:04,838
just to make sure that we're looking

284
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:06,098
at the right data and stuff.

285
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:08,907
So, I'll open up MySQLWorkbench

286
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:10,810
and I'll go ahead and connect

287
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,727
using my root password.

288
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:16,113
And here's my table student,

289
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:19,225
and I just simply do a Right-Click here on Select Rows,

290
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,058
and then there we go.

291
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:21,449
So, we have these five students

292
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:23,272
with their five email addresses.

293
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:26,024
And those are actually the same email addresses

294
00:13:26,024 --> 00:13:28,652
that we saw in the browser, alright?

295
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:31,942
So, our TestServlet, our Java Servlet,

296
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:34,748
is actually connecting to this MySQL Database,

297
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:38,774
grabbing the data, and then making it available.

298
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,210
So, this all looks really, really good.

299
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,543
Good job so far.
