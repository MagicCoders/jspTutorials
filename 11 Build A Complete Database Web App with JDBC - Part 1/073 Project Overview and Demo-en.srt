00:00:01,247 --> 00:00:02,281
<v Narrator>Hey.</v>

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,784
In this video, we're gonna learn how to create

3
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:07,617
a database application using servlets and JSP.

4
00:00:10,118 --> 00:00:11,918
So for our class project,

5
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:13,824
the main idea is that we're gonna build

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,798
a full working JSP and servlet application

7
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:19,196
that connects to a database.

8
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:22,479
So, we're gonna build the front end pages using JSP.

9
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:24,481
We'll build some of the back end controller code

10
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:28,232
using servlets, and we'll hook all of this into a database,

11
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:30,990
and it will actually talk to a MySQL database.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,157
Now, I'll show you how to build all of this from scratch.

13
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:38,544
Alright, so before we get into the coding,

14
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:41,063
let's look at a quick demo of the application.

15
00:00:41,063 --> 00:00:43,062
This is an application for a fictional company

16
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:44,802
called FooBar University.

17
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:46,847
We can list all of the students,

18
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:49,198
we can add a new student,

19
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:51,663
and we can also perform some actions on a student,

20
00:00:51,663 --> 00:00:54,359
like updating or deleting a student.

21
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,526
Let's go ahead and start off with adding a student.

22
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:01,486
Here's our add student form.

23
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:05,653
We can type in a first name and last name for a student,

24
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,955
and then we'll give his email address, bill@foo.com.

25
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:12,005
Once we're happy with this,

26
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:15,755
we can go ahead and click on the save button.

27
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:19,402
Okay, this looks really good.

28
00:01:19,402 --> 00:01:22,464
So note here, we have this new student, Bill Appleby,

29
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:24,895
and his email address is bill@foo.com.

30
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:25,728
This is great.

31
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:28,228
So, we've added a new student.

32
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:31,554
Alright, so now let's go ahead and update a student.

33
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:34,442
I'll go ahead and click the update button here.

34
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:36,161
So for Bill Appleby,

35
00:01:36,161 --> 00:01:38,986
I'm simply gonna change his email address.

36
00:01:38,986 --> 00:01:40,440
So instead of foo.com,

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,665
we'll change it to

38
00:01:41,665 --> 00:01:45,415
bill@luv2code.com, because he loves to code.

39
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:46,396
Yeah.

40
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:49,803
Then we'll hit the save button.

41
00:01:49,803 --> 00:01:50,914
Okay, so this looks good also.

42
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:53,603
Here's Bill Appleby, and note his email address,

43
00:01:53,603 --> 00:01:56,737
bill@luv2code.com, so we were successful there

44
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:59,237
in updating his email address.

45
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:05,234
Now, let's try this other item here of deleting the student.

46
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:07,865
It'll first prompt you if you want to delete the student.

47
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:10,683
We'll go ahead and click on OK.

48
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:12,897
Now, note it refreshes the screen,

49
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:14,559
it deleted that user,

50
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:18,100
so Bill Appleby is no longer in our list of students.

51
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,494
So, the delete operation worked out just fine for us.

52
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:24,874
Alright, so that covers the main CRUD features here

53
00:02:24,874 --> 00:02:26,008
for an application.

54
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:29,184
So, we'll learn how to insert, update, delete,

55
00:02:29,184 --> 00:02:32,235
and list all of the students for a database,

56
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,469
and we'll actually learn how to do all of this from scratch

57
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:36,890
in the following videos.

58
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,561
But first, what I wanna do is go ahead

59
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:40,078
and take a look at the actual database.

60
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,669
So, we have a database out here

61
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,845
with the given database table.

62
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:45,685
We have a table called student.

63
00:02:45,685 --> 00:02:48,583
If we simply do a query on this table,

64
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:50,411
we can see the list of students that we have.

65
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:53,723
So select rows, and it'll show us our five students.

66
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:56,080
So, these are the five students that we have out here

67
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,441
in our database right now.

68
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:59,647
And again, when we write all the code,

69
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,373
our application's gonna interact with this database table,

70
00:03:02,373 --> 00:03:03,964
insert, update, and delete,

71
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:06,381
and perform queries on this table.

72
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:07,895
And again, we'll figure out all the details

73
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:10,222
on how to set this database table up,

74
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:11,696
how to populate it with data,

75
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:15,738
and then how we can manage it and use it in our application.

76
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,443
Alright, so we have a lot of good things in store here,

77
00:03:17,443 --> 00:03:18,383
but you know me.

78
00:03:18,383 --> 00:03:19,718
I love to-do lists.

79
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:20,557
So, the first thing we're gonna do

80
00:03:20,557 --> 00:03:24,070
is learn how to set up our database dev environment.

81
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,194
Then, we'll learn how to list the students.

82
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:29,857
Next, I'll show you how to add a new student,

83
00:03:29,857 --> 00:03:32,586
and then from there, we'll learn how to update a student.

84
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:35,196
And then finally, I'll show you how to delete a student.

85
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:36,798
And again, we're gonna cover all of this

86
00:03:36,798 --> 00:03:38,605
step-by-step from scratch.

87
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,900
So, we'll cover each section here in separate videos,

88
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,701
and I'll walk you through all of the code.

89
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,249
We'll write all the code together,

90
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:47,504
and we'll test it out, and we'll make sure it works.

91
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:49,003
By the end of the video series,

92
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:51,189
we'll have a full database application

93
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,106
using servlets and JSP.
