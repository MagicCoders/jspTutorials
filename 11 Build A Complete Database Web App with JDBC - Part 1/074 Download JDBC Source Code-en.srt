00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:02,730
<v Instructor>Hi, in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,438
I'm going to show you how to download

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:07,521
the JDBC source code for our project.

4
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:10,650
So, when we work on a project,

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,264
you actually have two options on how

6
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:14,264
you want to work through the code.

7
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,534
The first option is that you can follow along

8
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:17,985
and write the code with me.

9
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:20,498
So I have a set of starter files that you can start with,

10
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,539
but then the bulk of the coding you'll actually do

11
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:24,985
from scratch, so a lot of hands-on coding

12
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:28,034
and you can follow along in the videos with me.

13
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:30,915
Or, you have an option two, you can skip

14
00:00:30,915 --> 00:00:32,704
writing the code. (laughs)

15
00:00:32,704 --> 00:00:35,286
You can kind of just sit back and enjoy the code.

16
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:37,772
And so I have the full solution code available

17
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,698
so all of the final code you'll have available.

18
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:42,701
You can access it, review it,

19
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:44,604
and then deploy it to your system.

20
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:46,991
So, either way, you can write the code from scratch

21
00:00:46,991 --> 00:00:49,601
with me or you can make use of option two and simply

22
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:53,343
just download all the finished code and deploy it.

23
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:56,355
So now how do you actually download the code?

24
00:00:56,355 --> 00:01:00,515
Well, in this video lecture there's a View Resources button

25
00:01:00,515 --> 00:01:02,760
in the upper right corner of the screen.

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,277
So you simply click that button, there's going to be

27
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:08,814
a file out there called jsp-servlet-jdbc-source-code,

28
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:12,981
and you simply download that zip file to your file system.

29
00:01:15,323 --> 00:01:17,405
All right, so here's my file system,

30
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:20,481
and let's assume that I've already downloaded the code,

31
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:21,627
the browser will normally put this

32
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:24,542
into the Downloads directory, so here's my zip file

33
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:27,897
that's been downloaded by my browser,

34
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:29,592
and what I normally like to do is just create

35
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:32,118
another little training directory.

36
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:34,241
I like to call it My Java Training

37
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:38,076
and just copy that zip file over there

38
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:39,897
and then I can move it to this directory

39
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:43,314
and now I can simply unzip that zip file.

40
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,181
All right, great, so I've unzipped the file here.

41
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:48,200
So now I have this folder called

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,617
jsp-servlet-jdbc-source-code.

43
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:52,807
Now there's a couple of files in here.

44
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:57,186
The first one is a README.txt, just a basic about me file,

45
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:58,823
SETUP-Instructions as far as how to set up

46
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:00,601
the project and deploy it.

47
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:02,327
There's a collection of SQL scripts

48
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:05,918
for creating a user and creating our database tables.

49
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:09,065
We'll talk about those SQL scripts later.

50
00:02:09,065 --> 00:02:12,438
And then here are our starter files, so our starter files

51
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:15,239
are really just a collection of some CSS files

52
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,748
like some cascading style sheets.

53
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:20,012
We also have some configuration information

54
00:02:20,012 --> 00:02:23,336
for database connection and also our database driver.

55
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:26,595
We'll talk more about these files in some later videos,

56
00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:28,346
but these are kind of the starter files

57
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:29,409
if you wanted to kind of start

58
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,826
from scratch working with me.

59
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:36,361
And then also again, if you don't want to write the code,

60
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:38,094
you simply want to get the final solution,

61
00:02:38,094 --> 00:02:40,964
well then this is in the web-student-tracker-solution

62
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:44,160
directory, so this has all of the Java source code

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,538
that we'll create, all the completed code is there,

64
00:02:47,538 --> 00:02:48,937
and also in the WebContent directory,

65
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:52,683
all of the JSP files and related web assets,

66
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,733
so basically everything's here.

67
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:57,230
You can grab this off the shelf as a final solution

68
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,223
and then take it and deploy it, so either way.

69
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,725
You can start from scratch or you can simply

70
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:03,702
take the solution and move on.

71
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:05,953
So the choice is yours. (laughs)

72
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,243
All right, so anyway, just wanted to let you know

73
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:09,149
about the files that are out there,

74
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:10,663
kind of a quick description for them,

75
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,334
and in some of the following videos

76
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:15,872
I'll dive deeper into this directory structure

77
00:03:15,872 --> 00:03:17,232
and then we'll make use of some of the these files

78
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:19,776
to get our environment set up.

79
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:21,443
All right, good job.
