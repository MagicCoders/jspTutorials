00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:02,636
<v Narrator>Hey! In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:06,803
we're gonna learn how to install MySQL on Microsoft Windows.

3
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:09,793
So as far as the topics here,

4
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:11,854
the first thing we're gonna do is download MySQL,

5
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:14,170
and then we'll install MySQL,

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,769
and then finally we'll verify our installation.

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:18,872
Alright, so a lot of good stuff.

8
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:22,455
Let's go ahead and jump in and get started.

9
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:28,793
Alright, so what we need to do is open up a web browser,

10
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:30,668
and visit the MySQL website.

11
00:00:30,668 --> 00:00:33,251
So, here in my browser I'll type in

12
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:37,553
dev.mysql.com/downloads and this will take me to the

13
00:00:37,553 --> 00:00:39,303
MySQL downloads site.

14
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:42,818
Alright, once I'm at the page

15
00:00:42,818 --> 00:00:46,069
I want to download the MySQL community server

16
00:00:46,069 --> 00:00:48,797
and on the community server page

17
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:50,498
they have an option here for downloading it

18
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:51,972
for Microsoft Windows.

19
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:56,139
I'll go ahead and select that option for download.

20
00:00:57,174 --> 00:00:59,159
This will take me to the download page

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,034
and I'll select the option here for downloading

22
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:03,246
the Microsoft Windows MSI Installer,

23
00:01:03,246 --> 00:01:05,155
and I'll choose the web version.

24
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:07,905
It's a small lightweight version.

25
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:10,810
Now, normally they want you to log-in,

26
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,371
but in this case I'll say no thanks,

27
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:15,371
just go ahead and start my download.

28
00:01:18,025 --> 00:01:20,336
Alright, so your browser will prompt you to save the file.

29
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:22,031
I'll go ahead and save the file and

30
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:25,781
let's start downloading it to my file system.

31
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:30,511
Okay, great, so it's downloaded.

32
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,769
We can open up our Windows Explorer,

33
00:01:32,769 --> 00:01:34,702
move into the downloads folder,

34
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:38,917
and now what I want to do is simply start the installer.

35
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,147
So this will start up a normal

36
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:42,897
Microsoft Windows install wizard.

37
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,295
Alright, so the standard thing here, right?

38
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,431
License agreement, go ahead and check the box

39
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:50,027
I accept the agreement.

40
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,001
Go ahead and click next.

41
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:54,416
Here we want to keep the developer defaults,

42
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:58,083
so make no changes there, developer default.

43
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,067
Next, they're gonna check

44
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:04,768
some of the requirements on your system.

45
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:07,943
So, the first product listed here is the MySQL workbench.

46
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:11,810
We need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ run time

47
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,149
but the installer will actually do this for you.

48
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:16,419
So, we'll simply select that and we hit execute,

49
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,922
and it'll go out to the web and

50
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:21,074
it'll download the appropriate dependencies that you need.

51
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,584
So, I'll just click, click, click,

52
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:26,235
accept all the defaults as it goes through this example.

53
00:02:26,235 --> 00:02:28,313
And at that point, we have everything available

54
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:29,695
for MySQL Workbench.

55
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:31,692
They'll prompt us about some of the other products,

56
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,915
you can just go ahead and click past that,

57
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:36,347
and then just hit execute and it'll start

58
00:02:36,347 --> 00:02:38,855
downloading all the dependencies that you need.

59
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:40,620
So, this will take awhile.

60
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,087
I'll kind of step away and I'll come back once

61
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:45,170
everything is downloaded.

62
00:02:46,692 --> 00:02:48,131
Okay, great, so we've downloaded everything.

63
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,856
Note here we have all green checks here

64
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:51,928
and the status is complete for everything.

65
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:52,967
So we're in good shape.

66
00:02:52,967 --> 00:02:56,154
So, we can go ahead and click next.

67
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,371
Click next one more time.

68
00:02:58,371 --> 00:03:01,193
Here, we'll set up some of the networking.

69
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:02,679
We'll just keep all the defaults.

70
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:03,666
Click next.

71
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:06,748
At this point, we need to define our root password.

72
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:09,674
So, you can give whatever you want for your root password.

73
00:03:09,674 --> 00:03:11,142
You can call it fubar or whatever.

74
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:12,791
I'm gonna give a long password,

75
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:15,728
just so it comes out as a strong password,

76
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,325
but you can give whatever you want.

77
00:03:17,325 --> 00:03:19,177
You can give a four letter password if you'd like.

78
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:20,523
They key item here is that you need

79
00:03:20,523 --> 00:03:22,276
to remember that password.

80
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:25,225
Make sure you write it down. (laughs lightly)

81
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:26,984
Alright, I'll go ahead and click next.

82
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:28,186
I'll keep the defaults here.

83
00:03:28,186 --> 00:03:30,160
It's gonna run MySQL as a Windows service.

84
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,586
I'll click execute, and it'll go off

85
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:35,889
and it'll start applying our server configurations.

86
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:38,472
I'll hit finish, I'll hit next.

87
00:03:41,191 --> 00:03:42,971
And, now we're going to do a simple test

88
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:43,999
to connect to our server.

89
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,311
Click the check button.

90
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,104
Connection is successful, we're okay.

91
00:03:47,104 --> 00:03:51,087
And then we hit next and finished, and next one more time.

92
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:52,689
And at this point we hit finish,

93
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:55,353
and it'll actually start up the MySQL server.

94
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:58,070
So, now what we're gonna do is verify our installation.

95
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,049
So, we're gonna use this MySQL workbench.

96
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:01,849
It's simply a web gooey tool.

97
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:04,090
I'm sorry, it's simply just a gooey tool,

98
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,259
that allows you to connect to your MySQL database.

99
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:09,070
So, here I just enter that same password

100
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,353
I did during installation,

101
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:12,931
and at this point I have a gooey open,

102
00:04:12,931 --> 00:04:15,543
and I can actually query some of the tables.

103
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:19,397
So, MySQL always starts off with some sample tables for you.

104
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:23,409
I'm gonna access this one table called city.

105
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:26,207
And I'll just do a right click, say select rows,

106
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,865
and this'll give me all the rows from this sample table.

107
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:30,769
So again, really here, we're just verifying

108
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,904
that we can connect to the database and do a basic query.

109
00:04:33,904 --> 00:04:35,913
So, this all looks really, really good.

110
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:40,080
So, our server is up and running and we can query it.
