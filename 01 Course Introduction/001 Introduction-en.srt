<v Chad Darby>Hi. This is Chad Darby with luv2code.com</v>

2
00:00:04,265 --> 00:00:08,489
and welcome to my course on Java Server pages.

3
00:00:08,489 --> 00:00:10,005
The main objective of this course is,

4
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,088
I want to show you how to build a JSP

5
00:00:12,088 --> 00:00:14,838
web application all from scratch.

6
00:00:16,723 --> 00:00:18,772
So here's the course road map.

7
00:00:18,772 --> 00:00:20,833
The first thing we're going to do is learn how to get

8
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,220
started with JSP by setting up our Development Environment.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,728
Then we'll explore some JSP scripting elements.

10
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:32,652
Next, we'll learn how to read HTML form data with JSP.

11
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:33,836
And then, I'll show you how to

12
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:37,646
manage application state with Cookies and Sessions,

13
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:39,271
and then we have a lot of more things that we'll

14
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:41,766
add to the course, so a lot of good things

15
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:44,516
coming up in this course for you.

16
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,306
Now, one thing about the course is that,

17
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:51,345
all of the source code is available for download.

18
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:53,653
So, you can download the source code at the beginning

19
00:00:53,653 --> 00:00:54,923
and then you can follow along with

20
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:57,273
the videos and review the source code,

21
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:59,445
or you can write it in all by yourself, if you'd like.

22
00:00:59,445 --> 00:01:00,827
It's totally up to you.

23
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,494
You have the option.

24
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:06,833
I'll present a lot of good information in the course,

25
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:10,694
however, you still may have a question or need help.

26
00:01:10,694 --> 00:01:13,689
No problem, simply post the question in the Udemy

27
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,873
classroom discussion and I'll come through and answer it.

28
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:18,857
I'm a very responsive instructor,

29
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:22,577
so I normally respond within the next 24 hours.

30
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:25,945
Feel free to post your questions to the Udemy discussion.

31
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:27,618
Okay, great a lot of good information

32
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:29,651
coming up here for this course.

33
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:33,294
I'm excited and I hope you are too.

34
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,239
We'll have a lot of fun in this course,

35
00:01:35,239 --> 00:01:38,489
