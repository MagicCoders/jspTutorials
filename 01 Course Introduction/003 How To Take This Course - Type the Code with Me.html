<p>As you go through the course, I highly recommend that type code along
 with me in the videos. This is the best way to learn the material.</p>



<p>Some students will watch the video first and then replay it while 
typing in the code. Others like to type along on the first watch. Choose
 whatever approach works for you.</p>





<p>But the important thing is that you type in the code. This is the most effective way to really learn the material.</p></p>
