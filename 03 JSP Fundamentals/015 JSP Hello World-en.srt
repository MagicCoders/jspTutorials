00:00:01,033 --> 00:00:01,994
<v Instructor>Hey!</v>

2
00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:03,744
In this video, I'm gonna show you how

3
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:07,161
to create a Hello World program with JSP.

4
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:10,856
So the common question is well,

5
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:13,054
what is a JSP file?

6
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:16,204
Well, a JSP file is simply an HTML page

7
00:00:16,204 --> 00:00:18,277
with some Java code sprinkled in.

8
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:20,710
And it basically gives you dynamic content

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,277
that you can include in your page.

10
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:26,953
So in this diagram here, this is a basic JSP file.

11
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:30,102
It has some HTML code, some Java code,

12
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:32,669
you can make some more HTML code, and so on.

13
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,644
The end result is that you'll have an HTML page

14
00:00:34,644 --> 00:00:38,644
with content that's generated by some Java code.

15
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:43,344
Alright, so the next question is well,

16
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,888
where is the JSP processed?

17
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:48,921
Well, a JSP file is actually processed on the server.

18
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:51,795
So it's processed on your tomcat server,

19
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:53,458
your glassfish and Java server.

20
00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:55,390
The result of the Java code is actually

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,486
included in the HTML returned to the browser.

22
00:00:58,486 --> 00:00:59,319
So here's an example.

23
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:03,106
We have a web browser, we make a request for a JSP page,

24
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:07,078
it goes across, the JSP pages processed by a server

25
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:11,376
and then the results of that Java code will generate HTML

26
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:13,361
and that those result will actually

27
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,811
return back to the web browser.

28
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,660
And if returned back to the browser,

29
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,993
just plain HTML.

30
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:24,679
So in a fact, the Java code can generate HTML

31
00:01:24,679 --> 00:01:27,512
that goes back to the web browser.

32
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:30,392
Alrighty.

33
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:32,994
So next where should we place the JSP file?

34
00:01:32,994 --> 00:01:37,283
Well, the JSP file goes into your WebContent folder.

35
00:01:37,283 --> 00:01:38,665
So you create a new eclipse project

36
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,061
that have a WebContent folder,

37
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,119
you place the file there.

38
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,590
Then one requirement is that the JSP file

39
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,314
must have a .jsp extension.

40
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:50,125
So, here's an example here we have on a slide.

41
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:52,348
WebContent helloworld.jsp.

42
00:01:52,348 --> 00:01:55,104
Now, it's just like any other normal HTML file

43
00:01:55,104 --> 00:01:56,180
that you place out there,

44
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,009
like building a normal website,

45
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:00,286
you can have multiple JSP files,

46
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:03,840
you can place your JSP files in sub direct and so on.

47
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,078
So, it's almost like building a website

48
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:07,240
with multiple HTML pages except

49
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,547
for here we'll have .jsp files

50
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,714
with that JSP extension.

51
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:16,708
Alright.

52
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,541
So you're probably wondering,

53
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:19,306
"Hey, show me the code!"

54
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,889
So here's an example of a code,

55
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:23,103
very basic Hello World program.

56
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:26,721
Again remember, a JSP file is simply an HTML page

57
00:02:26,721 --> 00:02:29,696
with a small bit of Java code sprinkled in.

58
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:31,599
So, here we have our body,

59
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,335
h3 Hello World of Java and then the time

60
00:02:34,335 --> 00:02:36,429
on the server is and right here,

61
00:02:36,429 --> 00:02:39,012
this is what we have Java code.

62
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:42,234
So, with JSP you make use the angle bracket percent

63
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:45,784
and then some of it you can put a JSP element.

64
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:46,617
So in this case, we're going

65
00:02:46,617 --> 00:02:49,410 line:15% 
to put what we call a JSP expression.

66
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,733 line:15% 
So we use the equal symbol.

67
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:52,630 line:15% 
So, angle bracket percent equal

68
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,233 line:15% 
and then we put in some Java code.

69
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,310
So this example, we create a new date object.

70
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,744
This will give us the current time stamp

71
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,788 line:15% 
and then we include the output

72
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:04,655 line:15% 
of the state object in the page.

73
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,253 line:15% 
So in effect, it will call about two-string method

74
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:09,010 line:15% 
on the state object and include the result

75
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:13,177 line:15% 
of that in this page that goes back to the browser.

76
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:17,302 line:15% 
So, I know I gave you a lot of information there,

77
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:19,757 line:15% 
let's go ahead and switch over and look at eclipse

78
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:24,638 line:15% 
and write this code and then we'll run it within eclipse.

79
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:25,471
Alright.

80
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,705
So, we're in eclipse.

81
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:28,383
So, the first thing we need to do is we need

82
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:30,716
to create a new web project.

83
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:34,191 line:15% 
So I'll go up to my file menu,

84
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:38,358 line:15% 
I'll say new and then I'll choose dynamic web project.

85
00:03:40,597 --> 00:03:42,424
And this will bring up the dialogue,

86
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:44,726 line:15% 
we can enter our project name.

87
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:47,089 line:15% 
Here I'll call it jspdemo.

88
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:48,090 line:15% 
You can give any name for the project

89
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,090 line:15% 
but here I'm just keeping it simple.

90
00:03:55,054 --> 00:03:58,577
Make sure that target runtime is setup for apache tomcat v8

91
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:01,549
and you can keep all the other defaults with no problem

92
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,716
and then simply hit the finish button.

93
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:09,062
So, this will create new project for us.

94
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:12,836
So we have jspdemo and if we expand this directory,

95
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,259
we'll see that we have a WebContent folder

96
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,470
and right now our WebContent folder is empty.

97
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,195 line:15% 
There is no pages that are created.

98
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:22,894 line:15% 
So here I'm going to create a new file.

99
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,802 line:15% 
So in the WebContent, I'll right click,

100
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:26,708 line:15% 
I'll say new file.

101
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:30,041
And I'll call this helloworld.jsp.

102
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:39,372
And once done with the file name,

103
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:41,622
I'll hit the finish button.

104
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:46,894
Alright.

105
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:47,727
So, here's our file.

106
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:48,560
It's empty right now,

107
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,303
so I'll just go and create a very basic HTML page

108
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:56,042
and eclipse will help me out with some of the tags here.

109
00:04:56,042 --> 00:05:01,001
And I'll set up a body and then I'll set up my h3,

110
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,584
Hello World of Java

111
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:07,727
and then I'll say the time on the server is.

112
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:10,090
And this where we'll drop in some Java code.

113
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,305
So, use that angle bracket percent with an equal symbol

114
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:15,405
and I say new Java util date.

115
00:05:15,405 --> 00:05:16,425
So again, it's going to create a new date object

116
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:19,079
with the current time stamp and then the result

117
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,679
of that time stamp will be included right here

118
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:25,684
in this page that will go back to the browser.

119
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:30,432
So, that's basically my Hello World JSP right now.

120
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:31,265
Alright.

121
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:33,469
So, let's go ahead and run this example.

122
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:34,379
So what I'll do is I'll move over here

123
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,671
to that file helloworld.jsp.

124
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:41,043
I'll simply right click the file and I'll say run as

125
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:43,543
and I'll choose run on server.

126
00:05:47,106 --> 00:05:48,006
So, eclipse will be first.

127
00:05:48,006 --> 00:05:49,458
It will say choose your server.

128
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,258
We're going to use the existing tomcat v8 server

129
00:05:52,258 --> 00:05:54,399
and in the bottom left we'll check the box

130
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,894
that always use the server when running this project

131
00:05:58,894 --> 00:06:01,643
and from there I can go and hit the finish button.

132
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:04,199
So this will actually start on my tomcat server

133
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,967
if it's not running and then

134
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:09,172
it should execute this JSP page.

135
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,084
So, great!

136
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:10,917
Here the results.

137
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:12,276
Hello World of Java.

138
00:06:12,276 --> 00:06:14,841
The time on the server is and they drop in the time stamp.

139
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,021
So this is the actual current time stamp

140
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:21,813
that I have on my server at the time of this recording.

141
00:06:21,813 --> 00:06:24,483
So note here, it created that new date object

142
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,225
and then the results of that date object

143
00:06:26,225 --> 00:06:28,475
were included in that page.

144
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:33,080
Now, what I'd like to do is copy this URL

145
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,773
and just drop in to a regular web browser.

146
00:06:35,773 --> 00:06:37,407
So I'll just right click,

147
00:06:37,407 --> 00:06:38,490
I'll say copy

148
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,457
and then I'll switch over to a web browser

149
00:06:43,457 --> 00:06:45,709
like Firefox and I'll just drop in that URL.

150
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:49,551
So just do a right click and I'll choose paste.

151
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:51,134
Then I'll hit enter

152
00:06:52,473 --> 00:06:55,030
and there's the JSP page inside of the browsers.

153
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,947
So, Hello World of Java

154
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,993
and the time on the server is.

155
00:07:00,993 --> 00:07:03,507
And so then I can right click and take a look at the source.

156
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,857
And so here's the source, so this is what,

157
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,170
this is kind of behind the scenes tour here.

158
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,904
So this is the source that came back to the browser.

159
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:13,474 line:15% 
So the time on the server is and it has this information.

00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,423 line:15% 
So, the web browser really doesn't know

161
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:17,244 line:15% 
how this code was generated.

162
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:19,553 line:15% 
It simply renders the response.

163
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:22,371 line:15% 
So, that's JSP in a nutshell.

164
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,278
Alright.

165
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:27,243
So, we covered a very basic JSP Hello World example.

166
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:30,536
We're going to dig deeper or dive deeper into JSP

167
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:32,437
as we go through in the following videos.

168
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:35,135
But that's enough, just to kind of get us started.

169
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,928
We can see the basics and we can check the box

170
00:07:37,928 --> 00:07:39,270
for Hello World.

171
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,755
Alright. So, stay tuned.

172
00:07:40,755 --> 00:07:44,836
A lot of good things in store in the following videos.
