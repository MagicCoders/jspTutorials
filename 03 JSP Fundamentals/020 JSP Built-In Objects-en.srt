00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,337
<v Instructor>Hey.</v>

2
00:00:02,337 --> 00:00:04,191
In this video, I'm gonna show you how to make

3
00:00:04,191 --> 00:00:07,108
use of JSP Built-In Server Objects.

4
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:11,554
So, with built-in server objects,

5
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,321
these are given to you for free.

6
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,179
So, there's no need to create them,

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,540
you can simply use them directly in your JSP page.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,991
And you've actually played around with some of this

9
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:24,765
earlier and I'll show you this in the next slide.

10
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:27,214
So, here's a list of the commonly used

11
00:00:27,214 --> 00:00:29,355
JSP Server Objects.

12
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:31,747
So, starting here, at the top with request.

13
00:00:31,747 --> 00:00:35,016
It contains information about the HTTP request headers

14
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:37,230
and also form data.

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,762
We're gonna use this a lot in some of the following

16
00:00:38,762 --> 00:00:41,145
videos for reading form data.

17
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:43,116
There's also the response object for sending back

18
00:00:43,116 --> 00:00:45,326
HTTP specific information

19
00:00:45,326 --> 00:00:47,540
and we'll use this also in the following video

20
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,685
on making use of cookies.

21
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:52,141
Now, this one server object you used already,

22
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,993
the out object, and we used that for our out.print line

23
00:00:54,993 --> 00:00:56,635
in one of the previous videos.

24
00:00:56,635 --> 00:01:00,113
So, again a built-in server object, given to you for free.

25
00:01:00,113 --> 00:01:01,838
Now, there's two others here.

26
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:04,542
Session. It's a unique session for each user.

27
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,474
You can kind of think of the session option as

28
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:07,942
kind of like a shopping cart.

29
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:10,296
You know, each user has their own unique shopping cart.

30
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:12,774
I will use this in the following video.

31
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:14,486
And finally there's the application object.

32
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:17,489
So, this is shared for all users of a given web app.

33
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:19,030
And I'll discuss various use cases

34
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,272
on how to use the application object.

35
00:01:21,272 --> 00:01:22,677
Now, just a full disclaimer,

36
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:24,591
this is not an exhaustive list.

37
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:26,668
There are other server objects out there,

38
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,026
but these are the ones that are

39
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:31,026
most commonly used for JSP web apps.

40
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:34,985
Alright, so here's the idea.

41
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:37,800
You have the browser communicating with JSP.

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,378
Behind the scenes, the HTTP protocol,

43
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:42,884
they actually send over a request object.

44
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:45,000
This request object contains header information

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,830
and body information.

46
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,302
The JSP can perform some work on that information

47
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:51,167
and then send back a response.

48
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:55,643
So, we have the whole request/response protocol going.

49
00:01:55,643 --> 00:01:57,008
In the demo, I'll actually show you

50
00:01:57,008 --> 00:02:00,175
how to make use of the request object.

51
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:05,217
Alright, so lets go ahead and move into Eclipse.

52
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:06,320
What I'd like to do is

53
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,064
continue to use the existing project, jspdemo.

54
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:14,295
Now, I'd like to move down to the folder here: WebContent,

55
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:16,800
because we're actually gonna create a new file.

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,301
So, I just say right click, I say New, File.

57
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:23,730
Now, the name I'll give here, I'll call it builtin-test.jsp

58
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,532
because we're, of course, testing some of the

59
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:27,150
built=in objects.

60
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,661
And once you're happy with the name,

61
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:31,697
we'll go ahead and click: Finish.

62
00:02:31,697 --> 00:02:32,657
Okay, great.

63
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:34,797
So, let's expand the window, here, for a second

64
00:02:34,797 --> 00:02:36,027
and that way we have a blank file,

65
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,344
we can just start writing some code.

66
00:02:37,344 --> 00:02:39,477
So, again, I start off with my html

67
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,560
and my body information.

68
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:46,374
I'll just set up a header 3,

69
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,639
just to give us a little name here for the page.

70
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,472
And then what I wanna do is I actually wanna

71
00:02:50,472 --> 00:02:52,494
read some information about the request.

72
00:02:52,494 --> 00:02:54,681
So, I wanna find out what type of browser

73
00:02:54,681 --> 00:02:58,014
the user is using to access my JSP page.

74
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:01,604
So, you can access this information

75
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:03,515
using the request object.

76
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:05,610
So, I can say request.getheader,

77
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,211
and then you give the header name of User-Agent.

78
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:10,023
So, this will tell you the actual browser

79
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,209
that the client is using.

80
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:12,949
Also, it'll tell you the operating system

81
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,949
that they're running on.

82
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:20,168
So, I'm gonna go ahead and add some line breaks, here.

83
00:03:20,168 --> 00:03:22,506
And now I also wanna find out what language the

84
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:25,423
client is making use of in their browser.

85
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:26,256
So, if they're using English,

86
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:29,065
Spanish, German, French.

87
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:31,648
So, here I say request.getlocal

88
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:34,866
and this'll give me the actual local that the user

89
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,116
has set up on their system.

90
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:43,019
So, we could use this to customize the type

91
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,637
of pages we send the user based on their actual local.

92
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:49,150
Like English or German or Spanish.

93
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,710
And that's basically it for this very basic demo, here.

94
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,501
So, go ahead and save your file,

95
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,769
and now let's go ahead and run this program.

96
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,128
So, I'll move to the file builtin-test.jsp,

97
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:00,427
I'll do a right click,

98
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:04,094
and I'll say run as, and then run on server.

99
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,863
Okay, great. So, the application runs.

100
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:10,109
Note here request user agent.

101
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,473
So, they'll tell us the type of browser

102
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:12,425
that's coming through.

103
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:13,583
So, here we're using this internal browser

104
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,803
that's built-in as part of this Eclipse tool.

105
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:20,679
But note it also says that we're using a Mac OSX.

106
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,438
So, we know the operating system and the browser

107
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:24,274
that user's running on.

108
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:26,224
Let me copy this information

109
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,366
and put into a different browser.

110
00:04:27,366 --> 00:04:31,449
I'll drop it into Chrome and I'll just paste it.

111
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,565
And I'll just hit: Enter.

112
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,706
And so now, we get the same information

113
00:04:37,706 --> 00:04:39,412
but note here it says Chrome.

114
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,827
So, they give us the actual Chrome browser that we're using

115
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:43,733
and the version, Mac OS,

116
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:46,187
and also the request language in English.

117
00:04:46,187 --> 00:04:48,391
So, again you could possibly use this to customize

118
00:04:48,391 --> 00:04:51,184
the different pages you want to send back to the user

119
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,568
based on their browser type, OS type,

120
00:04:53,568 --> 00:04:55,587
or their language type.

121
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,670
So, good job.

122
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,753
An example of using that built-in request object.

123
00:05:02,674 --> 00:05:04,802
Okay, great. Let's go ahead and wrap up this video.

124
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,340
In this video, I showed you how to use some of the built-in

125
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,634
server objects.

126
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:09,747
We may use the request object to find out the user's

127
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,571
operating system and browser.

128
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:13,874
In the following videos, we'll do a drill down into

129
00:05:13,874 --> 00:05:15,170
some of the other objects,

130
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,672
and you can kind of see them

131
00:05:16,672 --> 00:05:20,839
working out real world, for the various use cases.
