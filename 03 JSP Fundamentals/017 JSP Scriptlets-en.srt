00:00:01,606 --> 00:00:03,454
<v Narrator>Hello, in this video</v>

2
00:00:03,454 --> 00:00:07,037
we are going to learn about JSP Scriptlets.

3
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,507
So, what exactly is a scriptlet?

4
00:00:11,507 --> 00:00:13,867
Well a scriptlet is a JSP construct.

5
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:17,797
It allows you to add one to many lines of Java code.

6
00:00:17,797 --> 00:00:20,374
And, once you have this set up, then you can also include

7
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:24,385
content in the page by making use of out.print line.

8
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,672
So the basic syntax is angle bracket percent,

9
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:29,420
you write your x number of lines of code,

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,339
and then percent angle bracket.

11
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,189
And that code will be executed top down

12
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:35,439
when the page is processed.

13
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:38,994
Alright, so that's the background.

14
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:40,928
Let's look at a code example.

15
00:00:40,928 --> 00:00:43,033
So, very basic example here,

16
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,611
Hello World of Java,

17
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,411
and then I'll add a scriptlet.

18
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:48,512
Again, angle bracket percent.

19
00:00:48,512 --> 00:00:50,336
Once your inside the angle bracket percent,

20
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:53,623
then you can start writing real Java code.

21
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:55,690
So what I'd like to do here is set up a for loop.

22
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,374
for int i equals one, i is less than equal to five,

23
00:00:58,374 --> 00:00:59,758
i plus plus.

24
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:02,521
And, I'd like to print out I really love to code.

25
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:05,141
Now, instead of doing a system out print line,

26
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:07,316
I'll make use of out.print lines.

27
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,831
So this constant will be included

28
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:11,291
in the html page that's return.

29
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:14,230
So here I say out.print line I really love to code,

30
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,377
and I can add in the value of i.

31
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:18,773
Now, here's the output at the bottom of what we'll see

32
00:01:18,773 --> 00:01:20,439
once we run this JSP.

33
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,376
I will have our header, Hello World of Java.

34
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:27,144
So here we'll have our statement printed five times

35
00:01:27,144 --> 00:01:29,246
along with the actual loop index.

36
00:01:29,246 --> 00:01:32,191
And that's the basic there on setting up a JSP Scriptlet.

37
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:34,069
So angle bracket percent, and then you go ahead

38
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:36,486
and you write your Java code.

39
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:43,684
Alright now before we move into the actual coding demo,

40
00:01:43,684 --> 00:01:46,242
I want to just let you know about the best practice.

41
00:01:46,242 --> 00:01:50,432
You want to minimize the amount of scriplet code in a JSP.

42
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:52,055
So don't go overboard.

43
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:56,740
Avoid dumping thousands of lines of Java code in a JSP

44
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,497
because it makes it hard to maintain, it's poor design,

45
00:01:59,497 --> 00:02:01,323
and it's poor architecture.

46
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,039
What you want to do, if you have a lot of code

47
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,785
that you need to use in a JSP,

48
00:02:04,785 --> 00:02:08,069
I recommend that you refact this into a separate Java class

49
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,186
or make use of MVC.

50
00:02:10,186 --> 00:02:11,679
And I'll show you how to do both of those

51
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:12,824
later in the course.

52
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:15,237
I'll show you how to make use of a separate Java class.

53
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:17,740
I'll also show you how to make use of a MCV framework

54
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,721
when we servlets and JSPs working together.

55
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:23,114
But anyway, I just had to say this upfront

56
00:02:23,114 --> 00:02:24,945
as a best practice so you don't go off and do

57
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,695
things the wrong way.

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,557
Alright so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse.

59
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:34,153
And, let's write some code.

60
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,850
So what I like to do is I like to continue to use

61
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,433
the previous project, JSP demo.

62
00:02:39,339 --> 00:02:41,148
And what we're going to do here, we're going to actually

63
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:43,496
move into our web content directory,

64
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,587
and we are going to create a new file.

65
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:49,285
So I will just right click on web content,

66
00:02:49,285 --> 00:02:52,702
and I'll say new, and I will choose file.

67
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:59,646
So the actual name of the file that I'm going to set up here

68
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:02,063
is called scriptlet-test.jsp.

69
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,461
Alright, so that's the file name.

70
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:09,851
And once your happy with this file name,

71
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:14,283
you can go ahead and click the finish button.

72
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:15,942
Alright great, so we have this blank file

73
00:03:15,942 --> 00:03:17,859
and we need to start writing some code.

74
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,004
So first off, let me expand the window here.

75
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:24,329
And I will set up the basic html.

76
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,329
And I will go through and set up the basic body.

77
00:03:30,527 --> 00:03:32,734
Alright so, I'll set up that header three,

78
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,401
Hello World of Java.

79
00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:39,877
Okay great.

80
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:41,960
Now when I make use of a scriptlet, so again,

81
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,501
angle bracket percentage, and then we can

82
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:45,192
write our Java code here.

83
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:46,389
So I am going to something very similar

84
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:47,304
to what we had on the slide.

85
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:49,081
I'll simply set up a for loop for

86
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:53,248
i equal one, i is less than equal to five, i plus plus.

87
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,581
And then I want to print out some information

88
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:00,931
included in the page.

89
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:04,019
I'll make use of out.print line.

90
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,635
And then again, we are having fun here,

91
00:04:05,635 --> 00:04:08,682
I really love to code, woo hoo.

92
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:12,007
And I'll add the little loop parameter here.

93
00:04:12,007 --> 00:04:13,982
So there we go, so that's our scriptlet code.

94
00:04:13,982 --> 00:04:15,183
So we have a for loop.

95
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:16,786
We need to print out some information.

96
00:04:16,786 --> 00:04:19,019
We make use of that out.print line.

97
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,887
And, I know, there it is.

98
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,054
Pretty simple.

99
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,832 line:15% 
Alright so let's go ahead and save this file.

100
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,182 line:15% 
And, let's move over here and let's run it.

101
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:33,629
So let's right click on this file, scriptlet-test.jsp,

102
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:37,129
right click, choose run as, run on server.

103
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:42,637
And great, here's our output.

104
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:44,570
We have our Hello World of Java,

105
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,260
and then we have this code that was generated

106
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,620
by our for loop, I really love to code, woo hoo.

107
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,888
And we have the loop parameters going one through five,

108
00:04:52,888 --> 00:04:54,215
as you can see I am having a lot of fun here

109
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:56,442
with this really love to code.

110
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:57,609
But that's it.

111
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,513
OK, so this wraps up the video.

112
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,009
I showed you how to make use of JSP Scriptlets.

113
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:08,619
You can add some Java code to generate content

114
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:10,437
dynamically, on the fly.

115
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:13,164
The following videos will talk about JSP Declarations,

116
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:14,163
so stay tuned.

117
00:05:14,163 --> 00:05:16,746
A lot of good stuff coming up.
