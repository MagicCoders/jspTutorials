00:00:01,274 --> 00:00:03,432
<v Instructor>Hey, in this video I'm going to show you</v>

2
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:05,765
how to use JSP declarations.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,516
JSP declarations basically allow you to

4
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:15,095
declare a method in the JSP page,

5
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:18,815
and then you can call them from the same JSP page.

6
00:00:18,815 --> 00:00:21,659
So it's very useful like any normal code that you create.

7
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,359
If you need to execute some code

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,077
over and over again, you simply encapsulate it

9
00:00:26,077 --> 00:00:27,832
in a method declaration.

10
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:30,664
And you can do a similar thing here with JSP.

11
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,264
The syntax is basically an angle bracket, percent,

12
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:35,040
with an exclamation point, and then you declare

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,373
your method like any normal Java method.

14
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:43,760
Alright, so let's take a look at an example here

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,253
of a JSP declaration.

16
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,477
Up top, I'm gonna declare a method.

17
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:49,954
So, again, declarations, angle bracket, percent,

18
00:00:49,954 --> 00:00:52,129
with an exclamation point.

19
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:54,025
So once you're inside of here, this is just like

20
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:56,701
a normal Java method declaration.

21
00:00:56,701 --> 00:00:58,597
You have a return type of string,

22
00:00:58,597 --> 00:01:00,423
the name of the method, makeItLower,

23
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:03,435
any input parameters, in this case I have string data,

24
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:05,227
and then internally inside the body

25
00:01:05,227 --> 00:01:07,727
you write your actual implementation code.

26
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:10,013
So in this example, my implementation code

27
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:11,372
is going to be real simple.

28
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,351
For makeItLower, I'll simply take the data

29
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,742
and call .toLowerCase.

30
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,717
And again, very trivial method here.

31
00:01:18,717 --> 00:01:20,548
I just wanted to show you how to declare

32
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,465
a method in a JSP page.

33
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:26,938
And then at the bottom I can make use of that method.

34
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:29,739
So here I have a, make use of a JSP expression.

35
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,401
I'll do a angle bracket, percent, with an equals symbol,

36
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:35,050
and I say makeItLower and I pass in the string that

37
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,800
I want to convert, and that's it.

38
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:40,367 line:15% 
So at the bottom here,

39
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:41,775 line:15% 
this is what the output will look like.

40
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:43,899 line:15% 
So lower case "Hello World" then colon

41
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:45,914 line:15% 
and then I have the actual hello world.

42
00:01:45,914 --> 00:01:47,908 line:15% 
So the result of making that expression

43
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,130 line:15% 
or that method call,

44
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,802 line:15% 
the results will be displayed right here in that JSP page.

45
00:01:52,802 --> 00:01:54,802 line:15% 
And that's basically it.

46
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,900
Let's talk about some best practices.

47
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,110
This follows what I discussed earlier

48
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,966
with scriptlets, similar thing here.

49
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:07,720
You want to minimize the number of declarations

50
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,511
in a JSP page and also avoid dumping thousands

51
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:13,253
of lines of code in the JSP.

52
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:15,149
Also, you want to refactor this into

53
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:19,083
separate Java classes or make use of MVC,

54
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,976
and I'll cover all of that later in the course.

55
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:26,143
So in general, don't overdo it with JSP declarations.

56
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,968
Let's move into Eclipse and I want to continue

57
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:38,051
to use the existing project, jspdemo.

58
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:40,455
And what I'd like to do is move down

59
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:44,449
to this WebContent folder and I'm gonna add a new file.

60
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:46,057
So I'll simply do a right-click,

61
00:02:46,057 --> 00:02:47,640
I'll say New, File.

62
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,172
So I'm gonna create this new file.

63
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:57,339
The name of the file I'll call it declaration-test.jsp.

64
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:00,847
And once you're happy with the file name,

65
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,680
you can go ahead and click Finish.

66
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,349
All right, so here's our file.

67
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:08,615
It's empty; we need to add some code here.

68
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:12,404
So I'll start off with my normal html and body.

69
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:14,955
And now what I'd like to do is actually declare

70
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:16,666
a method so I use the JSP syntax,

71
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:19,450
angle bracket, percent, with the exclamation point.

72
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,568
So at this point, I can actually start writing

73
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,839
normal Java code, so I'm going to write a Java method.

74
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,814
So we have return type string,

75
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:28,450
method name of makeItLower,

76
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,540
input data of string, and inside I'll actually

77
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,414
write the real implementation code.

78
00:03:33,414 --> 00:03:35,076
And again, this very trivial example,

79
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:38,016
I'll just say data.toLowerCase.

80
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,135
And that's really it for this method declaration.

81
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:43,059
So again, with JSP, you make a declaration

82
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,826
by using the angle bracket, percent,

83
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:47,076
with the exclamation point.

84
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,331
Okay, great, so we have the method declared.

85
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,500
Now let's use this method.

86
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,917
So here, I'll have some text, lower case,

87
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:01,459
actually I'll say lower case hello world,

88
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,934
and then I'll make use of that JSP expression.

89
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:06,753
So I can call that method declaration.

90
00:04:06,753 --> 00:04:09,853
So I say makeItLower, and I pass in some data,

91
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:13,353
call it hello world, and then there we go.

92
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:18,225 line:15% 
So that's an example here of making a call to that method.

93
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,106 line:15% 
And I call it by making use of a JSP expression.

94
00:04:21,106 --> 00:04:23,062 line:15% 
So the result of this method call here

95
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,479 line:15% 
will be included here right in this page.

96
00:04:28,972 --> 00:04:31,337 line:15% 
All right, so let's go ahead and run the application.

97
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,635
So I move over here to this file declaration.jsp,

98
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:38,218 line:15% 
I'll do a right-click, and I'll say Run As,

99
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:40,539 line:15% 
Run on Server.

100
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:46,667
And then the browser will come up with our result

101
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:48,528
so we have lower case hello world,

102
00:04:48,528 --> 00:04:50,966
then we have, of course, the lower case version

103
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,836
of the hello world string.

104
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:54,549
And that's it, and that's the result of our

105
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:58,017
JSP expression making a call to our method

106
00:04:58,017 --> 00:05:01,464
that we declared using a JSP declaration.

107
00:05:01,464 --> 00:05:02,917
Good, so we kinda pulled it all together

108
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,964
with a nice little example.

109
00:05:04,964 --> 00:05:05,797
Good job.

110
00:05:10,238 --> 00:05:12,155
All right, so let's go ahead and wrap up this video.

111
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:14,961
So in this video I showed you how to use JSP declarations.

112
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:17,326
We created a declaration and then we called that

113
00:05:17,326 --> 00:05:19,659
declaration from a JSP page.
