1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,447
<v ->Hello, in this video I'm gonna show you how to use JSP</v>

2
00:00:04,447 --> 00:00:06,614
for including other files.

3
00:00:09,852 --> 00:00:11,999
So the common use case for including files is

4
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,653
including standard headers and footers.

5
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:17,583
So, say for example, you're building a website and you want

6
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:20,130
to have the same header and footer information displayed

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,706
on every page.

8
00:00:21,706 --> 00:00:23,516
So you can simply create the header and footer

9
00:00:23,516 --> 00:00:27,683
in separate files and include them in your JSP files.

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,628
Alright, so when you include a file, you can include

11
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:38,349
either HTML files or JSP files, it's totally up to you.

12
00:00:38,349 --> 00:00:41,456
So at the top here, I do a jsp:include,

13
00:00:41,456 --> 00:00:44,039
and page equals my-header.html.

14
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:47,268
A similar thing here at the bottom.

15
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:51,739
I can do a jsp:include, page equals my-footer.jsp.

16
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:52,575
And that's it.

17
00:00:52,575 --> 00:00:55,408
Very simple, very straightforward.

18
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:00,018
Alright, so let's go ahead and try this out.

19
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,586
So let's move into Eclipse.

20
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:03,532
What I'd like to do is to continue to use

21
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:06,115
that existing project, jspdemo.

22
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:11,075
And let's move down to the WebContent folder,

23
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:13,569
and what I want to do first is create those files

24
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:14,686
I'm gonna include.

25
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:16,341
So first I'm gonna create the header file,

26
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:18,091
so I'll say New File,

27
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:22,778
and I'll give the file name of my-header.html.

28
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:26,611
So that's the header that we're gonna include.

29
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:32,474
And when you're happy with the file name here, click Finish.

30
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:34,524
So for the header, I simply want

31
00:01:34,524 --> 00:01:36,591
to give the name JSP Tutorial.

32
00:01:36,591 --> 00:01:38,166
So I'm going to set up h1,

33
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:42,117
and I'll make the alignment for it to be center.

34
00:01:42,117 --> 00:01:45,024
And then inside the tag here, I'll just say JSP Tutorial.

35
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:46,874
So this'll be included on all pages

36
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:51,041
for my given website that I'm just making up right now.

37
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:54,680
So I'll go ahead and save this file.

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,847
So this is our header file that we have set up right now.

39
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:02,878
Now let's move over and let's create our footer.

40
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:05,503
So again, in WebContent, I'll do a right click,

41
00:02:05,503 --> 00:02:07,003
I'll say New File,

42
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:12,123
and I'll call it my-footer.jsp.

43
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:15,092
So in the footer we actually want to add some JSP coding.

44
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:16,892
So once we're happy with the file name,

45
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:19,059
go ahead and click Finish.

46
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:23,478
So, for here, for the footer for every page,

47
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:27,284
I want to give the time the page was last modified,

48
00:02:27,284 --> 00:02:30,461
or we're just gonna kind of make this up actually.

49
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:34,177
So here I'll just say last modified, or last updated,

50
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:37,328
and then I'll just drop in the actual date and time stamp.

51
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:40,632
So that way, all of our pages look fresh every time a user

52
00:02:40,632 --> 00:02:42,549
will visit our website.

53
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,995
Now I'll just hit the Save button.

54
00:02:46,995 --> 00:02:48,128
Okay, great, so now at this point

55
00:02:48,128 --> 00:02:49,809
we have our header complete

56
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:51,738
and we also have our footer complete.

57
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,174
So now we can go ahead and create our main page,

58
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,674
that's actually gonna include these files.

59
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:03,147
So I'll move over to the WebContent folder,

60
00:03:03,147 --> 00:03:04,308
I'll do a right click,

61
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:05,808
I'll say New File,

62
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,887
and I'll call this homepage.jsp.

63
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:17,859
And once we're happy with the name here, we'll click Finish.

64
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,363
So on this homepage, what we're gonna do is

65
00:03:24,363 --> 00:03:26,846
we're actually gonna include information

66
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:29,541
from the headers and the footers, and also we'll put some

67
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,004
of our regular content here.

68
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,332
So I'll do the standard work here for our HTML and our body.

69
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:38,819
And now I want to do is import, or include, the header.

70
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,774
So I'll say jsp:include,

71
00:03:40,774 --> 00:03:43,607
I give page equals my-header.html.

72
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:50,069
And now I can enter some regular content

73
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,703
that I'll have on my homepage.

74
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:53,562
Here I'm just gonna put in some filler stuff,

75
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,033
just some blah blah blah,

76
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,544
just to, you know,

77
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,044
placeholders here.

78
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:08,671
And then I'll copy this line x number of times,

79
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:12,004
just to kind of fill it up a little bit.

80
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,688
So that's our content.

81
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,242
Let's go ahead and include our footer.

82
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:21,409
So I'll say jsp:include, page equals my-footer.jsp,

83
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:24,892
because our footer is a JSP file.

84
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:27,164
And again, it can go either way, HTML or JSP,

85
00:04:27,164 --> 00:04:30,684
depending on how you want to build out your pages.

86
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:33,371
And that's it, so I can go ahead and save this file,

87
00:04:33,371 --> 00:04:36,394
and then I can go ahead and run it.

88
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:39,694
Alright, so I can move over to this file homepage.jsp,

89
00:04:39,694 --> 00:04:42,490
I can do a right click, then I can say Run As,

90
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,407
and then Run on Server.

91
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,974
Okay, great, this looks really good.

92
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:53,853
So up top, we have our header file

93
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:56,377
that we included, JSP Tutorial.

94
00:04:56,377 --> 00:05:00,236
Then we have all of our body, our blah blah blah stuff.

95
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:02,121
And then we have the actual footer.

96
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,047
And then notice how the footer is a JSP,

97
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:06,442
and it included the current timestamp

98
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:08,301
when this page was accessed.

99
00:05:08,301 --> 00:05:12,152
So our site will always look fresh as far as fresh content,

100
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:13,396
which is a good thing, right?

101
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,298
(chuckles)

102
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:17,131
So, good job.

103
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,281
In this video, I showed you how to build JSP pages

104
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:21,364
by including other files.
