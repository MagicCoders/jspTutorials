00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:02,298
<v Chad>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:06,465
In this video, we're gonna learn how to use JSP expressions.

3
00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:11,755
So, in JSP, there's actually

4
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:14,543
different types of scripting elements.

5
00:00:14,543 --> 00:00:17,324
There's three actually, JSP expressions,

6
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,801
JSP scriptlets, and declarations.

7
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:22,106
Now, what we'll do is we'll actually have a deep dive

8
00:00:22,106 --> 00:00:24,463
on each one of these topics in separate videos

9
00:00:24,463 --> 00:00:27,457
but I wanted to give you just an overview real quick.

10
00:00:27,457 --> 00:00:31,299
So a JSP expression is basically a small Java expression

11
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:32,975
that you can include in the page

12
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:36,425
of the syntax's angle bracket percent with an equal symbol.

13
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:38,499
And we'll see a lot of that in this video.

14
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:41,224
There's also what we call a JSP scriptlet.

15
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:44,074
So a JSP scriptlet is simply an angle bracket percent

16
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:45,643
and then you add some Java code.

17
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:48,249
You can add one to many lines of Java code

18
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:50,426
and we'll see that in a following video.

19
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:52,975
And then finally, there's a JSP declaration.

20
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:56,126
So this is angle bracket percent with an exclamation point.

21
00:00:56,126 --> 00:01:00,399
And so here, you can define a Java variable or method.

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,796
And again, we'll do a deep dive on that.

23
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,293
So this next slide here is on JSP expressions.

24
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:08,379
So, basically you can compute some type of expression

25
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:11,327
and the result of that is included in the HTML page

26
00:01:11,327 --> 00:01:14,230
that's returned to the browser.

27
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,420
And so, here's an example

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,691
and we saw this from one of our previous videos.

29
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:20,362
Actually the previous Hello World video.

30
00:01:20,362 --> 00:01:23,487
In your JSP file, you can say the time on the server is

31
00:01:23,487 --> 00:01:24,978
and then you can add an expression.

32
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:27,050
So again, remember, angle bracket percent

33
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,698
with an equal symbol and we can place a Java object there.

34
00:01:30,698 --> 00:01:32,954
Once this is processed by the server,

35
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:35,953
then the generated HTML is simply the two string version

36
00:01:35,953 --> 00:01:38,120
of that given date object.

37
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,332
But let's take a look at some more examples

38
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:43,415
of using JSP expressions.

39
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:48,396
So in this next example,

40
00:01:48,396 --> 00:01:51,757
I'm gonna show you how we can convert a string.

41
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:55,045
So here I have this new string Hello World.

42
00:01:55,045 --> 00:01:57,495
And then I can say .toUpperCase.

43
00:01:57,495 --> 00:02:00,395
So I'm gonna basically convert this string to all caps

44
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:02,004
or to all upper case.

45
00:02:02,004 --> 00:02:03,674
And the result of that will be included

46
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:05,167
right here in the page.

47
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,903
So that's for like strings and objects.

48
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:11,547
You can also make use of mathematical expressions.

49
00:02:11,547 --> 00:02:15,250
So here I can multiply a value 25 times four equals

50
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,023
and you could put any math expression in there

51
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:18,487
that you'd like.

52
00:02:18,487 --> 00:02:21,780
You can also have Boolean expressions.

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,197
So here, I could say, is 75 less than 69?

54
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:29,138
And it'll give me a value of true or false.

55
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:31,766
And that's an example here of using JSP expressions.

56
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:34,829
So we saw objects, mathematical expressions,

57
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:37,329
and also, Boolean expressions.

58
00:02:42,126 --> 00:02:43,873
OK great, so let's move into Eclipse

59
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,290
and let's try this stuff out.

60
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:49,747
I like to continue to use the same project

61
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:52,747
from the previous video, jspdemo.

62
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:55,315
I'd like to move down to my WebContent folder

63
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,424
and what I wanna do here is actually create a new file.

64
00:02:58,424 --> 00:03:02,174
So I'll just right click, I'll say new, file.

65
00:03:03,534 --> 00:03:05,043
And for the name of this file,

66
00:03:05,043 --> 00:03:08,376
I'll simply call it expression-test.jsp.

67
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:14,803
And once you're happy with that file name,

68
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:18,553
you can go ahead and click the finish button.

69
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:22,636
OK great, so we have a very basic file here

70
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,256
and actually an empty file.

71
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:25,806
And we need to add something in it.

72
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,587
So let's go ahead and start off with our basic HTML.

73
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,587
I'll set up my body tag.

74
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,926
And now I'll go ahead and type out that first bit

75
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:38,009
of converting a string to upper case.

76
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,251
And now what I'd like to do is add a JSP expression.

77
00:03:44,251 --> 00:03:46,349
So again, angle bracket percent.

78
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:49,682
And so here I say new string Hello World

79
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:53,660
and I do a dot and I get the code completion here

80
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,139
and I'll say .toUpperCase.

81
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,472
I'll select that item there.

82
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,862
It's kinda cool Eclipse can kinda help you out

83
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:08,473
with some of the code completion there in a JSP file.

84
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:10,677
Alright, so that's it, so, that's the file.

85
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:12,927
I can go ahead and save it.

86
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,751
And what I'd like to do is go ahead and run this file.

87
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:19,096
So I'll just do a right click, I'll say run as,

88
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:22,013
and then I'll choose run on server.

89
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:25,674
Alright so this will start up my Tomcat server

90
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,259
if it's not running already.

91
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:29,736
And then right here in the browser it'll give us the result.

92
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,555
Converting a string to uppercase.

93
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,696
And remember we had Hello World as normal case

94
00:04:33,696 --> 00:04:36,265
and now this basically converted Hello World

95
00:04:36,265 --> 00:04:37,765
to all upper case.

96
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:40,904
So that's the result of our JSP expression running

97
00:04:40,904 --> 00:04:42,654
which is really cool.

98
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:51,986
Alright, so let's take this a little bit further.

99
00:04:51,986 --> 00:04:55,653
I'm just gonna add some line breaks in here.

100
00:04:57,522 --> 00:04:59,020
And now I wanna do an example

101
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,059
using a mathematical expression here.

102
00:05:02,059 --> 00:05:05,809
So here I'll say 25 multiplied by four equals

103
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:13,379
and now again I'll make use of my JSP expression.

104
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,409
Angle bracket percent with an equal symbol, 25 times four.

105
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:19,836
So the result of this is of course is 100, right?

106
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:22,512
And the value of 100 will be included right there.

107
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:24,679
So I simply save the file.

108
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,248
So now here I can simply go back to my browser.

109
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,256
I don't have to run it again.

110
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:31,559
All I have to do is simply reload this page

111
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,717
and the results will show up.

112
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:36,098
So I'll simply hit the reload or the refresh button here.

113
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:37,157
And there it is.

114
00:05:37,157 --> 00:05:40,166
25 multiplied by four equals 100.

115
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,461
Mission accomplished, very good.

116
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:44,138
So again, a nice thing here with JSP.

117
00:05:44,138 --> 00:05:45,579
If you make any changes to the file,

118
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,141
you don't have to rerun it or redeploy.

119
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:51,308
You simply just reload that page and you're ready to go.

120
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:54,527
OK, let's do one more thing.

121
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:56,693
Let's play around with Boolean expressions.

122
00:05:56,693 --> 00:05:59,938
So let me just move down here, add a line break.

123
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:01,975
Let me just add some extra white space here

124
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:04,475
just so we can see everything.

125
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:10,135
And I'll just have a very basic Boolean expression example.

126
00:06:11,195 --> 00:06:12,778
Is 75 less than 69?

127
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,282
And now I'll let Java compute this for me.

128
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,631
Again, very trivial, right?

129
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,834
But we're just showing you an example here

130
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:21,834
of a Boolean expression.

131
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:25,041
So, 75 less than 69.

132
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,974
This will evaluate as true or false.

133
00:06:26,974 --> 00:06:29,411
Of course, we know this will return false, right?

134
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:31,700
But we'll see how the JSP program

135
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,950
will help us out with this.

136
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,218
Alright, so I'll save the file here.

137
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:42,961
I'll move back over to the browser.

138
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:47,128
And again, all I have to do is just reload or refresh.

139
00:06:48,559 --> 00:06:50,403
And then there it is.

140
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:51,876
Is 75 less than 69?

141
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:52,709
False.

142
00:06:52,709 --> 00:06:53,542
So very good.

143
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,500
So we saw a really good example there

144
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,382
of using JSP expressions for Booleans.

145
00:06:58,382 --> 00:07:01,882
Also for math and also for string objects.

146
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,271
Alright, so let's go ahead and wrap up this video.

147
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:08,418
We did a deep dive on JSP expressions.

148
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:10,236
I showed you different types of expressions

149
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:12,491
using objects, math expressions,

150
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,278
and also Boolean expressions.

151
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:17,828
In the following videos, we'll dive into JSP scriptlets

152
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:20,787
and we'll also dive into JSP declarations.

153
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:23,620
So stay tuned, I'll see you there.
