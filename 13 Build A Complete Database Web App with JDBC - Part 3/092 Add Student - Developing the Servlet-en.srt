1
00:00:01,346 --> 00:00:02,745
<v Chad>Alrighty, we can check the box there</v>

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:04,006
for step number two.

3
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,751
So moving onto step three, we're actually gonna update our

4
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:08,771
StudentControllerServlet.

5
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:11,669
And basically we're gonna handle the requests coming in

6
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:14,002
and also read the form data.

7
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:19,115 line:15% 
So, moving into Eclipse,

8
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:21,059 line:15% 
what we wanna do is open up our code

9
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:23,476 line:15% 
for StudentControllerServlet.

10
00:00:29,874 --> 00:00:32,083 line:15% 
And so when the form data is submitted,

11
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,705
they're actually gonna pass the data,

12
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:36,699
or they're actually gonna call the method on doGet,

13
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:38,730
because that form's gonna send data over

14
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,206
using a get request.

15
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,730
So it's gonna come into this doGet method.

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,210
Currently right now, all we do is simply list the students,

17
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,658
but what we need to do is actually read the command

18
00:00:49,658 --> 00:00:51,758
and route the code accordingly,

19
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:53,388
depending on if they're gonna add a student

20
00:00:53,388 --> 00:00:55,564
or list a student.

21
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:58,213
So I'll just put a little comment here for

22
00:00:58,213 --> 00:01:00,680
read the command parameter.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,263
And then once we read that command,

24
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:06,430
then we need to route it to the appropriate piece of code.

25
00:01:07,494 --> 00:01:09,829
So as you see, I like to put comments here

26
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:11,829
to keep myself on track.

27
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:17,212
So I can simply read the parameter by saying

28
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:21,045
String theCommand = request.getParameter,

29
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:25,350
and the parameter is command.

30
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:32,023
And then basically what I wanna do

31
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:33,700
if the command is missing,

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,804
like if it's null or just wasn't passed over,

33
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:39,970
then I'll simply default to listing the students.

34
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:42,619
So then I'll say theCommand = "List",

35
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:45,863
just kinda assign it by default.

36
00:01:45,863 --> 00:01:49,202
So this way my code is somewhat flexible,

37
00:01:49,202 --> 00:01:51,192
in that if they don't give us a command

38
00:01:51,192 --> 00:01:54,109
then we'll at least be able to list

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,039
without hitting a null point or exception.

40
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,361
Then what I wanna do is basically do a switch on the command

41
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:02,615
and based on that value,

42
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:06,282
I wanna route it to that appropriate method.

43
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,499
So the command,

44
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:24,277
so case of list, meaning that if the command equals list,

45
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,129
then I'll call that method listStudents

46
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:28,555
passing in the request response.

47
00:02:28,555 --> 00:02:31,690
And it's the same method that we had earlier

48
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,523
in our Servlet so far.

49
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:43,975
So that's the first case that I'll test for.

50
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:47,502
Then I'll also check for the case of add.

51
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:49,383
So again, if the command comes over

52
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:51,358
where the command equals add,

53
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:54,492
then here I wanna call a method called addStudent

54
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:58,325
and I'll pass in that request response object.

55
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,439
And then also I'll just have a,

56
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:06,151
I'll set up a catchall, a default case,

57
00:03:06,151 --> 00:03:09,771
or like an else, meaning that if none of those things match,

58
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:12,592
or match up then we'll just default

59
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,991
and then our default operation will be listStudents.

60
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:18,423
So if they send over a bad command that we don't understand,

61
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:21,715
we'll simply just send them back the list of students.

62
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:23,690
And we're keeping it simple for right now.

63
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,492
We could get real nasty with them

64
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:26,871
and give them a bad error message

65
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:30,288
but for now we'll just list the students.

66
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,852
So that's basically it for our routing logic here,

67
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:38,019
when the command comes in.

68
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:43,862
So this looks good, but there's one problem,

69
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:45,962
and there's a problem on line 59

70
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:50,554
and Eclipse is not gonna let us get away with it. (chuckles)

71
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:52,970
And it says hey this method addStudent,

72
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,846
we don't know about it,

73
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,445
and just like we did in the previous videos,

74
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,043
we'll say okay, Eclipse,

75
00:03:58,043 --> 00:03:58,876
well then why don't you go ahead

76
00:03:58,876 --> 00:04:01,376
and create that method for me?

77
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,225
And so I'll select the link and viola!

78
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:08,610
Eclipse will create this nice little method for me,

79
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,990
called addStudent

80
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,623
and I can go ahead and write some of my code in there.

81
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:13,501
So, cool.

82
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:17,090
I just love it when Eclipse writes code for me.

83
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,165
I just wish it could write all the code. (chuckles)

84
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:23,234
But no worries, that's why we're here, right?

85
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:25,428
That's why we get paid all the big bucks,

86
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:26,776
cause we are the experts.

87
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,193
We are the gurus.

88
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:30,946
So again, I'm gonna stretch out here

89
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,795
and get some white space

90
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:36,588
and actually what I'll do before I start writing code,

91
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,406
is I'm gonna write some more comments

92
00:04:38,406 --> 00:04:40,961
just to kinda tell myself what to do

93
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,628
when it's time to add a student.

94
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,585
So I'm gonna read the student info from the form data,

95
00:04:50,585 --> 00:04:52,231
and based on that data I'm gonna create

96
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:53,981
a new student object,

97
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:59,096
and then I'll add that student to the database,

98
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:01,792
and then finally once it's added to the database,

99
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,939
we wanna send them back to the main page,

100
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:07,936
meaning we wanna get a list of all the students again

101
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:10,835
so we can see our new person that we just added.

102
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:15,002
So that's the game plan for this add student method.

103
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,616
Alright so let's go ahead and dig in

104
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,920
with this read student info.

105
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,942
Again, this is reading form data, right?

106
00:05:24,942 --> 00:05:27,606
So we're simply doing request.getParameter

107
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,111
and we're given the form field.

108
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,929
So here starting out with first name,

109
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:32,779
it's called firstName.

110
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:34,722
And then I simply copy this line

111
00:05:34,722 --> 00:05:37,026
and just paste it for the other fields,

112
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:39,628
cause it's just a copy paste exercise now.

113
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:43,795
Last name, and then a similar thing here for email.

114
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:48,452
And so basically that's it.

115
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:50,537
That's the code here for reading student info

116
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:52,120
from the form data.

117
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:55,521
Alright, now moving on down here,

118
00:05:55,521 --> 00:06:00,129
we can use this information to create a new student object.

119
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:03,437
So I'll say Student theStudent = new Student,

120
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:04,910
and I can pass in those values,

121
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,493
firstName, lastName, and email.

122
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:13,327
So at this point, I have a student object

123
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,994
that's been created.

124
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:20,866
Then I wanna actually add the student to the database.

125
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:23,866
So I'll make use of my studentDbUtil

126
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:30,440
and I'll say addStudent and I'll pass in theStudent object.

127
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:40,568
Now again, we have a problem here.

128
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,496
Eclipse doesn't know about the method.

129
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:43,667
I'm gonna tell Eclipse,

130
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:47,834
hey buddy, go ahead and create this method for me.

131
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:51,753
Okay, great.

132
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:53,994
So Eclipse actually created this method for us.

133
00:06:53,994 --> 00:06:57,803
So we're actually in this class StudentDbUtil,

134
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:00,546
and if we scroll back down to our method,

135
00:07:00,546 --> 00:07:04,511
they actually created this method here addStudent.

136
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,172
So this is kinda really cool.

137
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:09,323
Now, we're not really doing the JDBC stuff right now,

138
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:12,207
so I'm just gonna put a little heads up that,

139
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:13,837
do nothing for now.

140
00:07:13,837 --> 00:07:16,549
We'll actually add this code in a following video

141
00:07:16,549 --> 00:07:17,771
but I'll just kinda put the placeholder

142
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,153
in there for right now.

143
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:21,157
So anyway, so that,

144
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:23,495
at least that clears the air here for line 84.

145
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:26,160
So we do have a method here called addStudent

146
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,633
even if it does nothing,

147
00:07:27,633 --> 00:07:29,404
that method does exist now.

148
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:33,495
And then finally I wanna send them back to the main page.

149
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,269
Just so they can list all the students and so hey,

150
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:38,479
I just reuse that method that I already have,

151
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,146
listStudents and pass in a request response.

152
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:45,768
So this actually kinda worked out pretty good,

153
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:49,685
I can just reuse some code that I already have.

154
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:54,764
Except for there's one small little problem here.

155
00:07:54,764 --> 00:07:56,238
So let's see what the problem is.

156
00:07:56,238 --> 00:07:58,949
I can just hover over and it will say

157
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:01,269
there is an unhandled exception.

158
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,570
So okay, good.

159
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,799
So in this case I wanna add a throws declaration.

160
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,993
I wanna choose the first option here,

161
00:08:07,993 --> 00:08:10,360
add throws declaration.

162
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,993
So what it's gonna here on that method

163
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:17,554
that we're working in right now, addStudent in the Servlet,

164
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:21,559
at the far right they're gonna add throws Exception,

165
00:08:21,559 --> 00:08:23,845
because it's possible that method we call there

166
00:08:23,845 --> 00:08:25,905
could throw an exception and we need to either handle it

167
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,958
or list ourselves as throwing it.

168
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,698
And I'll just take the shortcut for now.

169
00:08:29,698 --> 00:08:31,375
So there we go, so throws.

170
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,221
So we're good to go.

171
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,961
It takes care of all the issues here

172
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:38,099
and this is basically the code here for adding a student.

173
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,409
And this is the code that's in our Servlet for right now.

174
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:46,673
Alrighty, so we can go ahead and save that.

175
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:49,870
And I think we can even try and run this thing.

176
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,120
Let's try that.

177
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,478
So back up here to my application,

178
00:08:54,478 --> 00:08:55,478
just run it.

179
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,895
And so now we have our nice little button here,

180
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:04,525
Add Student shows our form.

181
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:05,795
So we already built the form

182
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:08,208
so we can go ahead and fill it out with some information,

183
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,199
our Andrew Whittaker.

184
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:12,449
And it's andy@luv2code.com.

185
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:17,268
And once we're happy with that info we hit save

186
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:18,101
but oh no!

187
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,798
Andy's not in the list, why?

188
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,318
Well because our database code

189
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:25,559
doesn't really do anything yet.

190
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,907
Aagh!

191
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,744
No problem, we kinda knew that already.

192
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:31,547
So this is good for right now,

193
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:34,211
at least we have the Servlet code in place.

194
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,076
In the next video,

195
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,380
we're actually gonna put the database code in place

196
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,888
to actually do the database insert.

197
00:09:40,888 --> 00:09:43,888
So, I'll see you in the next video.
