1
00:00:01,356 --> 00:00:04,076
<v ->All right, so the first task in our to do list</v>

2
00:00:04,076 --> 00:00:06,627
is to update the list-students.jsp

3
00:00:06,627 --> 00:00:10,673
and we're actually gonna add that new button onto the page.

4
00:00:10,673 --> 00:00:15,456
We're gonna have the Add Student button on our page.

5
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:18,206
So let's dive in and get started.

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,636 line:15% 
<v ->All right, so basically what I wanna do</v>

7
00:00:27,636 --> 00:00:31,817 line:15% 
is add that button to this list-students.jsp page.

8
00:00:31,817 --> 00:00:35,067 line:15% 
So I'll go ahead and open up that page.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,632
I'll expand my window here.

10
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:41,854
And then I'll basically move down

11
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:44,687
to an area right below the header.

12
00:00:47,363 --> 00:00:50,502
And right here in this content section

13
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:53,002
I want to put in a new button.

14
00:00:53,838 --> 00:00:55,649
So I'll just write out a little HTML comment

15
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:58,566
just to again keep myself on track.

16
00:01:03,225 --> 00:01:07,392
All right, so I'll set up this input type="button".

17
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:15,632
And the value is Add Student, so that's the actual label

18
00:01:15,632 --> 00:01:18,215
that they'll see on the button.

19
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:22,107
And I also wanna add some other items here

20
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:24,386
so when they actually click the button

21
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:26,967
I wanna tell the system what to do.

22
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,533
So onclick then I basically wanna show

23
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:32,366
my HTML form for adding a student.

24
00:01:40,064 --> 00:01:41,954
So again, onclick, I simply give

25
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:45,199
the name of the form that I want them to display.

26
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:48,199
So this is our add-student-form.jsp.

27
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:59,745
And then finally here I wanna add a little fancy CSS style.

28
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,605
So here I'll say add-student-button.

29
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:04,110
That's the style from the style sheet that we're using

30
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,631
that it'll apply to that button just to give it a color,

31
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,798
rounded edges and all that good stuff.

32
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,751
So that's basically really all we need to do

33
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:17,918
for adding a new button here on our list-student.jsp.

34
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:21,252
Now let's go over and try it out here.

35
00:02:21,252 --> 00:02:24,085
So I'll just run my web app again.

36
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,924
So great, this looks really good.

37
00:02:31,924 --> 00:02:34,534
Take a look, we have our new button here, Add Student.

38
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,930
Looks really fancy.

39
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,142
I'm impressed.

40
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,225
(laughs)

41
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:44,548
Now, actually, I'm not impressed.

42
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:45,727
(laughs)

43
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:48,606
Cause when I click that button it gives me a 404 error.

44
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:50,326
Like, what's up with that?

45
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:53,310 line:15% 
Well, of course right, we haven't created this file yet.

46
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,740 line:15% 
We haven't created the add-student-form

47
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,540 line:15% 
and that's our next order of business here.

48
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,042 line:15% 
So, what I'll do is actually just create

49
00:03:00,042 --> 00:03:01,902 line:15% 
a placeholder for the form right now.

50
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:04,091 line:15% 
Just a very simple page but at least

51
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:06,883 line:15% 
I just wanna create that file.

52
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:09,357 line:15% 
So I'll just do a new file and then I'll give

53
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:13,107 line:15% 
the name of the file of add-student-form.jsp.

54
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:19,967
And for this again just a real simple placeholder here.

55
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:22,884
So, I just wanna put just something

56
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:27,194
real simple here just so the file exists

57
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:32,736
because were trying to make a good impression.

58
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,563
All right, so let's save this.

59
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:37,250
And now if we go back to our browser

60
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,084
we should see something slightly different.

61
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:44,467
So I'll just click on back, do a little refresh here,

62
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:47,378
and then click on Add Student.

63
00:03:47,378 --> 00:03:50,062
And boom, cool, all right, great.

64
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,847
So we have this little placeholder file.

65
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:53,626
So we created that new file

66
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:55,801
and just put just some very basic text there.

67
00:03:55,801 --> 00:03:58,426
But we're in good shape for right now.

68
00:03:58,426 --> 00:04:00,175
What we'll do in the following video

69
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:02,864
is that we'll actually fill out the form

70
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:06,471
and put proper form fields and submit buttons

71
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,309
and all that good stuff but at least we have

72
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:10,651
kind of the basics in place for right now.

73
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,555
So, I'll see you in the next video

74
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:14,863
when we'll hook up our new form.

75
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:15,946
See you then.
