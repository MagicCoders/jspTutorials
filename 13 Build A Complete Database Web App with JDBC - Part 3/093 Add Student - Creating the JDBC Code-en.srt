1
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:03,155
<v Chad>Alright, so we're making some good progress.</v>

2
00:00:03,155 --> 00:00:05,103
We've covered the first three steps,

3
00:00:05,103 --> 00:00:09,062
the last step here is updating our StudentDBUtil.

4
00:00:09,062 --> 00:00:11,268
So, this is where we're actually gonna make use

5
00:00:11,268 --> 00:00:12,878
of that addStudent method

6
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:16,292
and we're actually gonna put the real JDBC code in there

7
00:00:16,292 --> 00:00:19,459
for doing an insert into the database.

8
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:26,716
So, just a quick recap here in our StudentControllerServlet.

9
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:35,555
In our addStudent method here,

10
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:36,722
we have a call

11
00:00:38,922 --> 00:00:41,255
to studentDbUtil.addStudent,

12
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,715
so that's in place right now,

13
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:48,117
but what we need to do is actually put some real code inside

14
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:49,707
of that method.

15
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,043
So, I can just go to this method here

16
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:52,235
and navigate to it,

17
00:00:52,235 --> 00:00:54,432
let me show you this little Eclipse trick here.

18
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:56,139
I can choose the method, right-click,

19
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,909
and I can say Open Declaration, or I can hit F3,

20
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,984 line:15% 
and it'll actually take me directly to that code,

21
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:04,968 line:15% 
so that's an Eclipse trick for you.

22
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:08,169 line:15% 
So, now I'm in my StudentDBUtil right now

23
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,921 line:15% 
and I'm at this method here, addStudent,

24
00:01:10,921 --> 00:01:11,754 line:15% 
so DBUtil,

25
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:14,902 line:15% 
addStudent.

26
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:19,163 line:15% 
In this method, this is where we're gonna do our JDBC work,

27
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:22,527 line:15% 
so we're gonna get low-level, get a connection,

28
00:01:22,527 --> 00:01:24,431 line:15% 
all of that good stuff.

29
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:27,670 line:15% 
So, let me clear out this method here

30
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,375 line:15% 
and again, I always like to start with comments,

31
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,418 line:15% 
just to kinda let me know

32
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,168
what I need to write.

33
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:38,185
So, I already know upfront I'm gonna need a throws Exception

34
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:42,185
so I'll just go ahead and put that in there now.

35
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,215
So, I'll need to create a SQL statement

36
00:01:49,215 --> 00:01:50,829
for doing the insert,

37
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:53,209
I'll also need to set up the parameter values

38
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,376
for the query.

39
00:01:55,902 --> 00:01:58,886
I'm sorry, the parameter values for the SQL

40
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,909
based on the student's information.

41
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:03,683
I'll need to execute the SQL insert

42
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:08,397
and then finally, I'll need to clean up my JDBC objects,

43
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:10,754
so that's basically the game plan

44
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:12,983
of things that I need to do in this method

45
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:14,733
for adding a student.

46
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:22,525
So, I'll just set up some basic JDBC objects here for

47
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:26,595
Connection and a PreparedStatement,

48
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:34,030
and I'll also set up my little try catch block here,

49
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:40,802
and also take care of the imports,

50
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:43,885
so import java.sql.PreparedStatement.

51
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,463
Alright, so let's start off here

52
00:02:49,463 --> 00:02:51,982
with creating the SQL for the insert.

53
00:02:51,982 --> 00:02:54,475
So, this is the SQL that we're gonna do for

54
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:58,480
actually doing the insert into the database

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,813
for the student,

56
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:02,265
but actually, whoa,

57
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,343
I actually need to get my connection first.

58
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:05,295
I forgot about that,

59
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:07,014
so that's the first thing we're gonna do here,

60
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:08,847
is get our connection.

61
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:14,698
Now we can go through and write our SQL String.

62
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,696
So, I'm gonna make use of SQL,

63
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:22,330
I'll say insert into student.

64
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,326
That's our table name.

65
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:27,693
Then I need to give the actual columns

66
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:29,943
and then the actual values,

67
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:36,609
so the columns are first name comma last name, comma email,

68
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:41,440
and make sure you keep an extra space at the end

69
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,644
of those lines there, inside the quotes.

70
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:47,012
And then for values, I'll make use

71
00:03:47,012 --> 00:03:48,963
of the question mark placeholders

72
00:03:48,963 --> 00:03:52,411
because I'm using PreparedStatements.

73
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:55,743
So, PreparedStatements are based off of placeholders

74
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,694
and you fill in those placeholders

75
00:03:57,694 --> 00:04:00,444
or param values with actual data,

76
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:05,797
so I'll go ahead and set those param values now

77
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:08,047
in this next piece of code.

78
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:10,531
So, first off, I'll just kinda prepare

79
00:04:10,531 --> 00:04:11,564
the statement upfront,

80
00:04:11,564 --> 00:04:14,653
say myStmt equals myConn.preparedStatement

81
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:15,950
based on that SQL

82
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,266
and now I can go through and set the actual param values.

83
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:21,319
So, here I can say setString,

84
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,235
I get the parameterIndex of one

85
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:26,985
and I get the value of the student.FirstName.

86
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:31,188
So, the parameter values for PreparedStatements

87
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,106
are one-based, meaning that the first one is at one,

88
00:04:35,106 --> 00:04:38,670
not zero, so don't wanna confuse you there.

89
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,221
Alright, because everything else in Java is zero-based,

90
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:44,019
like arrays, but our param values here,

91
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:47,290
for PreparedStatements, are one-based.

92
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,902
So, anyway, one for first name,

93
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:52,819
two for last name, three for email.

94
00:04:55,603 --> 00:04:56,436
Alright, so that looks good.

95
00:04:56,436 --> 00:04:58,490
So, we have all the param values set,

96
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,650
now it's just a matter of executing that SQL statement,

97
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,367
so I'll simply say myStmt.execute

98
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,446
and it'll do the work.

99
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:06,525
So, it should take a student,

100
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:08,649
perform an insert into that student table,

101
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:09,982
and there we go.

102
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,549
So, that's kinda the big game plan there

103
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:16,632
for this method in our StudentDBUtil,

104
00:05:18,587 --> 00:05:22,012
so get a connection, create SQL, set the param values,

105
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:24,970
and execute the SQL insert.

106
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,594
And then finally, I need to clean up the JDBC objects

107
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,068
because I have a connection object

108
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:30,542
and a statement,

109
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:34,757
so I simply use a close on myConn comma myStmt,

110
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:36,039
comma null.

111
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,232
This last null here is for a result set.

112
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:41,653
In this case we don't have a result set,

113
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:44,764
so we simply pass in the value of null

114
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:45,931
and that's it.

115
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:51,962
So, we have out addStudent method in place,

116
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:53,795
so we are ready to go.

117
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:56,153
Alrighty, so let's do that.

118
00:05:56,153 --> 00:06:00,320
So, I'm gonna go ahead and run the application again.

119
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:05,999
It's gonna give me my list,

120
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,135
I'll hit the Add Student button.

121
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:12,052
I'll enter the data again for Andrew Whittaker,

122
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:15,657
and andy@luv2code.com,

123
00:06:18,386 --> 00:06:19,886
then I'll hit Save

124
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,375
and then, boom!

125
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:27,849
Check it out at the bottom, Andrew Whittaker,

126
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:29,648
so he's actually in the database

127
00:06:29,648 --> 00:06:31,471
and this is really, really cool.

128
00:06:31,471 --> 00:06:35,128
I'm excited about it, but you may wonder,

129
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,997
I don't believe you,

130
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:40,830
so let's go and actually look at the database.

131
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:45,124
So, I'm logging into my database here

132
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:48,863
and I will go to this web_student_tracker,

133
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:52,357
my Tables student and I will query that table,

134
00:06:52,357 --> 00:06:54,389
and then, there it is.

135
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,387
So, he's there at the bottom,

136
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:57,768
so he's ID number six, Andrew Whittaker.

137
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:01,720
So, the data really is making it into the database

138
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,077
and so we have our database interaction,

139
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:04,910
so this is cool.

140
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,514
So, we did the full circle here

141
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:11,101
of writing the code all the way from the beginning

142
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:14,178
and then following it all the way to the back end

143
00:07:14,178 --> 00:07:15,385
with the Database UTL,

144
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,717
so I would say mission accomplished

145
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:21,225
for the addStudent feature.

146
00:07:21,225 --> 00:07:24,892
So, I'd say good job, we made it through it.
