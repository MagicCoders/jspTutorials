00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:03,391
<v Instructor>Hi, in this video we're gonna learn how to</v>

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:05,891
add a student to our database.

3
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,634
So we'll cover the following topics.

4
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:14,998
Fist we'll get a quick demo of the add student feature,

5
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:15,983
then we'll look at the big picture,

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:19,024
and then we'll also take a look at the sequence diagram

7
00:00:19,024 --> 00:00:22,441
just to see how everything fits together.

8
00:00:25,453 --> 00:00:27,002
Alright, so let's first start with the demo

9
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:28,266
of the add student feature.

10
00:00:28,266 --> 00:00:30,410
So in our home page we're gonna have

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,100
this new button here called add student.

12
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,520
Basically the user will click on this add student button

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,020
and will show them a new form.

14
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:42,244
Okay great, so here's the form.

15
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:43,739
We'll collect the students first name,

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,587
last name and email address.

17
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:49,670
So I'll go ahead and enter some sample data here.

18
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,314
So I have this student Andrew Whittaker

19
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:56,897
and his email address is andy@luv2code.com.

20
00:00:58,346 --> 00:00:59,842
So then once we're happy with the data

21
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:03,592
we can go ahead and click on the save button.

22
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,858
Okay great, so we just added the student.

23
00:01:08,858 --> 00:01:12,600
So note here on our list we have the new student

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,950
Andrew Whittaker and his email address, andy@luv2code.com.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,962
So we're actually reading this information from the database

26
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:21,830
so that previous screen at form, we would actually insert

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,414
or add the students to the database,

28
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:26,344
and now here we're seeing the results of that query.

29
00:01:26,344 --> 00:01:28,639
So this looks really good, and we'll learn how to build up

30
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:31,972
all of the code in the following videos.

31
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,395
So this is kind of the big picture here.

32
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:41,723
So we start with our home page list students.jsp,

33
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:43,323
a list of all of our students.

34
00:01:43,323 --> 00:01:45,672
Then we click the add student button.

35
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,963
It takes us to the add student form.

36
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:49,796
As you saw in the demo,

37
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,471
once you fill out the information in the form

38
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:53,828
and hit save, that actually sends it over

39
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,829
behind the scenes to our servlet

40
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,496
which is our student controller.

41
00:01:59,488 --> 00:02:01,068
This student controller reads the form data

42
00:02:01,068 --> 00:02:04,127
and then passes it over to our student database Util

43
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:08,044
who actually does the insert into the database.

44
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:12,883
Now some of the details behind the scenes here.

45
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:15,345
So that form we actually sent the data over

46
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:17,458
using the get method. So they'll call

47
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,286
the doGet method on the servlet.

48
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:23,675
And then we'll create this hidden form field called command.

49
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:24,965
So command equals add.

50
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:27,218
So this is something that we make up

51
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:30,380
specific for our project, I kinda just made that up

52
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,463
that command.

53
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:34,152
It's a hidden form fill, we'll send it over

54
00:02:34,152 --> 00:02:36,130
then our servlet will read that command

55
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,690
and figure out that it needs to add a student.

56
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,536
Because, in the future we'll have other features for editing

57
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,847
a student and also deleting a student.

58
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:48,538
So I just wanted to give additional commands there.

59
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:49,924
So again, I love my to do list, right.

60
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:52,619
So the first thing we need to do it update our list students

61
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:54,619
jsp, to add that button.

62
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,216
Then we're gonna create the html form,

63
00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:00,873
and then update our student controller servlet.

64
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:04,684
And then finally we'll work on our student database Util

65
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,182
to do all the low level JDBC work

66
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,557
of adding the student to the database.

67
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:10,915
So that's the big game plan.

68
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:14,362
So, we'll break this up over multiple videos

69
00:03:14,362 --> 00:03:15,594
just like we've done before.

70
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,311
We'll wright all the code from scratch,

71
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:22,384
and at the end we'll have a full working example.

72
00:03:22,384 --> 00:03:23,249
I'm excited,

73
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:24,665
a lot of work ahead,

74
00:03:24,665 --> 00:03:26,578
and we'll knock it out together.

75
00:03:26,578 --> 00:03:29,328
So I'll see ya in the next video.
