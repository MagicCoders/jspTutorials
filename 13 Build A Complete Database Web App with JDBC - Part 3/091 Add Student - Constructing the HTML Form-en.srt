1
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:02,441
<v Chad Darby>Alrighty, so we can go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,441 --> 00:00:04,459
and check the box there for the first step.

3
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:05,530
That's done.

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,150
Now we'll focus on step two, creating

5
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,528
the HTML form for our new student.

6
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:13,463
So we'll have a form, we'll have text fields

7
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:15,884
for first name, last name, and e-mail,

8
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:17,796
we'll have a save button, and then we'll have

9
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:19,325
a little link at the bottom to take them

10
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:21,867
back to the original list.

11
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:24,163
So that's the big picture, that's the game plan.

12
00:00:24,163 --> 00:00:25,815
Let's go ahead and dive into Eclipse

13
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:27,732
and let's start coding.

14
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:34,146 line:15% 
Alright, so we have some unfinished business

15
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:35,392 line:15% 
here with the form.

16
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:38,582 line:15% 
Our previous form simply had a placeholder.

17
00:00:38,582 --> 00:00:42,665 line:15% 
Now we need to get in here and do some real work.

18
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:48,311 line:15% 
So I'll just expand the window here, open it up.

19
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:51,769
And for this page, first I'll just

20
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:54,344
take care of some general HTMl housekeeping,

21
00:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,833
so I'll set up like the doc type,

22
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,755
and then I'll get in here and I'll set up

23
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:00,838
the header for this page.

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,059
So we'll set the page title for add student.

25
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:16,896
And this page is also gonna make use of some style sheets.

26
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:20,896
So I'll set up a reference for two style sheets.

27
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,326
So the first style sheet is basically

28
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:32,547
what we used before, style dot CSS,

29
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:34,251
and then we'll have another reference here

30
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,977
for a special style sheet specifically

31
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:39,195
for this add student form.

32
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:42,260
So the file is called add student style dot CSS.

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,124 line:15% 
But we don't have that right now.

34
00:01:44,124 --> 00:01:46,303 line:15% 
It's actually in our starter files,

35
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:49,353 line:15% 
so what we'll do is we'll actually copy that CSS

36
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:52,637 line:15% 
from the starter files and put it into this project.

37
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:55,669 line:15% 
So let me just swing over to my finder window,

38
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:59,169 line:15% 
just bring it on screen here for a second.

39
00:02:00,182 --> 00:02:02,334 line:15% 
Alright, there it is.

40
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:05,182 line:15% 
Again, on our source download,

41
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:07,950 line:15% 
then I'll go down to the starter files directory,

42
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,937 line:15% 
and I'll move into web content, CSS,

43
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,178 line:15% 
and there's a file in there called

44
00:02:12,178 --> 00:02:14,599 line:15% 
add student style dot CSS, so that's

45
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,746 line:15% 
the new CSS file that we want.

46
00:02:16,746 --> 00:02:19,199 line:15% 
So we'll simply copy that file,

47
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,116
and we're gonna copy it to our Eclipse project.

48
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:26,753
So I just do a copy here, then

49
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:29,336
I'll move back over to Eclipse.

50
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:33,756
And under CSS, then I'll paste that file.

51
00:02:41,712 --> 00:02:42,782
Alright, so this looks pretty good.

52
00:02:42,782 --> 00:02:47,130
So, on line eight, this is where we referenced that new file

53
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,812
and we referenced the CSS add student style dot CSS.

54
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:53,617
So that's the new file that we just copied over.

55
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:55,066
So that all works out.

56
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,347
So we're good to go with that.

57
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,262
And if you want to, you can go look at this CSS.

58
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,575
Again, I'm not a CSS guru.

59
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:03,724
You can peruse this on your own.

60
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:05,303
I normally have friends help me out

61
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:08,441
or I just kinda copy some stuff off the web.

62
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,383
That's the piece there.

63
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:11,839
But anyways, we have our header set up,

64
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,204
we're in good shape.

65
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:14,634
But now it's time for us to focus in

66
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,537
on the body of our page.

67
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:20,423
So, I'll actually put in some more housekeeping stuff here

68
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:21,506
for our body.

69
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:26,693
Primarily just like the header information

70
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:27,976
for the actual page.

71
00:03:27,976 --> 00:03:31,143
I'll just put this in here real quick.

72
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:36,345
So, we simply just do some divs here again,

73
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:38,745
wrap our header, FooBar University.

74
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:40,485
Same thing that we saw before in

75
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:43,164
some of the previous videos.

76
00:03:43,164 --> 00:03:47,331
Here I set up the H three for the add student header.

77
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:53,674
And now this is where I get down to business here.

78
00:03:53,674 --> 00:03:55,374
So I set up this form.

79
00:03:55,374 --> 00:03:57,682
Action equals student controller servlet.

80
00:03:57,682 --> 00:04:00,538
So we're gonna send data to the student controller servlet

81
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:02,645
using the method equals get.

82
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:05,112
So this I'll actually call the do get method

83
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:07,945
on our student controller servlet.

84
00:04:08,806 --> 00:04:11,090
And we learned about form submissions earlier in the class,

85
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,243
but this is just more of a refresher

86
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:18,052
and a real-world application for it.

87
00:04:18,052 --> 00:04:19,508
Now, also remember, earlier I said

88
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:21,169
we're gonna have a hidden form field.

89
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:23,538
So I have this input type equals hidden,

90
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:26,742
and the name equals command, value equals add.

91
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:30,044
Again, this is specific to us.

92
00:04:30,044 --> 00:04:32,692
We're kinda making this up, so name equals command,

93
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:34,780
we can give any name we want there.

94
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,467
Value equals add you can give any value.

95
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,942
But we're just gonna follow the convention of

96
00:04:38,942 --> 00:04:41,348
name equals command, value equals add.

97
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,798
But add could be anything.

98
00:04:42,798 --> 00:04:47,254
It could be add student, add data, add stuff, whatever.

99
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:51,982
But I'm just gonna keep it simple for right now.

100
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:53,656
Now I'm gonna set up a little table,

101
00:04:53,656 --> 00:04:57,847
and this table's gonna hold the different form elements,

102
00:04:57,847 --> 00:05:01,298
like the actual label and the actual text field

103
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:02,626
that the user will enter their data.

104
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:05,543
Just to kinda keep things lined up.

105
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,298
So, for this first table row, I'll just set up

106
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:15,834
the entry, the label, for first name.

107
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:19,859
And then I'll also set up a input type, or text field,

108
00:05:19,859 --> 00:05:21,109
for first name.

109
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,196
So, again, this'll basically give me a label

110
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:29,529
and then a input text field.

111
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:34,258
Alright, so let's go ahead and try this out.

112
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:37,490
So let me move back over to my app,

113
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,705
and I will take a look at my add student form

114
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:42,373
and I'll just show it in the browser.

115
00:05:42,373 --> 00:05:45,378
So I'll just simply right click, do a run as,

116
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,192
run on server, and then, boom, looks pretty good.

117
00:05:48,192 --> 00:05:49,506
So this is our form.

118
00:05:49,506 --> 00:05:51,488
It's very crude right now, but it's our form.

119
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:53,256
So we have our header, add student,

120
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:55,969
and then we have this first label here, first name,

121
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:58,218
and a text field.

122
00:05:58,218 --> 00:05:59,709
So basically all we need to do now

123
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,107
is kinda more of the same.

124
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:04,988
Just kinda copy paste for all the other names there.

125
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:07,349
There's a little typo I had in this thing,

126
00:06:07,349 --> 00:06:08,938
I just fixed that.

127
00:06:08,938 --> 00:06:10,671
Lowercase T for student.

128
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,558
And again, just kinda copy paste this

129
00:06:13,558 --> 00:06:14,990
x number of times.

130
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,768
So, drop in a copy paste here, another copy paste,

131
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:21,160
and then I'll just go through and update the labels.

132
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,027
So this is for last name.

133
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:25,161
I'll set the field name for last name.

134
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:29,266
And then the third one here is for e-mail.

135
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:33,451
And I'll set the name of this field as e-mail.

136
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:34,853
So, again, remember with the form,

137
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:36,372
when you have these name entries,

138
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:39,039
these are the actual parameter names that you'll use

139
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,209
when you read the form data in your actual servlet code.

140
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:44,620
And then the one last thing I need to do here

141
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,204
is another copy paste.

142
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:50,371
I need to just put in an entry here for the submit button.

143
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:59,389
And then the actual value for this button is save.

144
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:01,535
So value equals save.

145
00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:05,175
And then I even have a CSS style that I wanna apply to it,

146
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,813
so here I have class equals save.

147
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:10,186
So that's something from the cascading style sheet.

148
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:13,436
And that's our submit button basically.

149
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:20,730
Alright, so let's go ahead and just do

150
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,147
a quick refresh on this form.

151
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:26,682
And, woo hoo.

152
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:27,515
Looks pretty good.

153
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:29,667
It's starting to shape up here.

154
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,725
So, we have our fields here for first name,

155
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:34,356
last name, and e-mail, and we have our submit button

156
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:35,939
here at the bottom.

157
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:39,035
So this looks really, really good so far.

158
00:07:39,035 --> 00:07:39,868
Good job.

159
00:07:41,213 --> 00:07:42,526
And now, one last thing I wanna do

160
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:44,969
is I wanna add a link at the bottom of that form,

161
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,136
just so the user can go back to the list students page.

162
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:52,270
So I'll just enter a quick little div here,

163
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:55,687
just to give us a nice little line break.

164
00:07:59,429 --> 00:08:00,919
And then I'll just set up a link

165
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,298
back to the original page.

166
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:06,465
So, here I have, I'll set up an anchor href equals,

167
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:09,855
and I'll just basically point back to the

168
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:12,105
student controller servlet.

169
00:08:19,549 --> 00:08:22,966
And then, here I'll just say back to list

170
00:08:24,234 --> 00:08:25,287
or something like that.

171
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,120
Yeah, there we go.

172
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,203
That'll work.

173
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,685
And so that would give me a little link

174
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:33,127
that'll point back to the original page

175
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:36,671
that'll list all the students out.

176
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:40,066
Then I can go back over here and just do a little refresh.

177
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:41,341
And then, cool, so in the bottom right

178
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:44,520
I have that href link back to list.

179
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,928
So, cool, so we're in good shape for right now.

180
00:08:46,928 --> 00:08:48,797
So anyways, mission accomplished.

181
00:08:48,797 --> 00:08:50,318
We've created our form.

182
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,597
We have everything set up, and in the following video

183
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:56,680
we'll work in our servlet to read this form data.
