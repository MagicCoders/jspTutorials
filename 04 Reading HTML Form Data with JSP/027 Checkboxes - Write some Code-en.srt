1
00:00:01,333 --> 00:00:02,288
<v Instructor>Alright, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,288 --> 00:00:04,121
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:07,297
And what we're gonna do, is this project

4
00:00:07,297 --> 00:00:08,938
will work similar to the previous one.

5
00:00:08,938 --> 00:00:11,968
We're actually gonna start with our student-form.html.

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:13,809
We use that as a starting point, and then

7
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:16,413
we just add new features in here for the checkbox.

8
00:00:16,413 --> 00:00:18,478
So the first thing I'm gonna do with student-form.html

9
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:22,395
is I'll do a right click, and I'll choose Copy.

10
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:28,747
And then I'll, again, I'll do a right click

11
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:30,580
and I'll choose Paste.

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,205
And now, the new name here, we'll call this

13
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:38,455
student-checkbox-form.html.

14
00:00:40,482 --> 00:00:42,545
So that's the new name for it.

15
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:45,565
And then once you're happy with the name, you can click OK.

16
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:46,570
Now let's go ahead and open up

17
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:49,237
this student-checkbox-form.html.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,981
So the first thing we need to do here on line seven,

19
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:57,126
we need to change the JSP that we're gonna send the data to.

20
00:00:57,126 --> 00:01:01,294
So here I call it student-checkbox-response-jsp.

21
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:03,134
That's the new JSP that we're gonna create

22
00:01:03,134 --> 00:01:05,551
a little later in this video.

23
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:13,684
Now let me expand my window here.

24
00:01:13,684 --> 00:01:16,220
And also let me just get some extra white space down here,

25
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:18,007
so I can have some room to play.

26
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:19,860
Add another line break.

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,325
And now I'll go through and start entering

28
00:01:21,325 --> 00:01:23,873
the information for my checkbox.

29
00:01:23,873 --> 00:01:27,540
So here I'll say input type="checkbox",

30
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:32,842
name="favoriteLanguage",

31
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:37,381
value="Java".

32
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:40,398
And then we put our label out to the side Java.

33
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:42,000
So again, very similar to radio buttons.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,081
The only thing that's different here

35
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:46,409
is the input type="checkbox".

36
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,798
And now what I can do, is I can simply repeat this process

37
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:52,131
for all the other languages.

38
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,502
So I'm just gonna speed up the video here for a bit,

39
00:01:56,502 --> 00:01:58,928
while I just do a copy paste, and do a quick update

40
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:01,095
for those other languages.

41
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,000
Alright, I'll just save my file.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,437
So okay, this looks really good right now.

43
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:07,663
So basically, I have the four languages here,

44
00:02:07,663 --> 00:02:10,315
input type of checkbox, and that works out really well.

45
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:12,778
So our html form for the checkboxes,

46
00:02:12,778 --> 00:02:14,978
is pretty much taken care of for right now.

47
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:15,811
Good job.

48
00:02:19,437 --> 00:02:20,700
Alright, so let's do a similar thing here

49
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,792
for our response page.

50
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,923
So again, we're gonna use that student-response.jsp

51
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:27,639
as a starting point, and then we're gonna customize it.

52
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,214
So I'll simply copy this file.

53
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:35,206
And then I'll right-click and I'll do a paste for it.

54
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,982
And the new name that we'll give here, of course,

55
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:39,732
is student-checkbox-response.jsp.

56
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:45,069
And once you're happy with that name, go ahead and click OK.

57
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,363
So now we have this new file here,

58
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:49,449
student-checkbox-response.jsp.

59
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,725
Now let's go ahead and double-click this file

60
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:51,975
and open it up.

61
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,923
This is the original confirmation page from before.

62
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:01,340
I'm just gonna add some line breaks here.

63
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:04,727
And I just expand the window,

64
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:07,810
so I can have more room to work with.

65
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:12,467
And so, what I need to do here,

66
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,030
is I need to display the list

67
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,194
of favorite programming languages that the user selected.

68
00:03:17,194 --> 00:03:20,361
So it's gonna be an html list of data.

69
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:27,155
And I just want to get some more white space

70
00:03:27,155 --> 00:03:28,311
here at the bottom.

71
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:29,894
Give me one second.

72
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:36,380
Alright, so I'll make use of an html tag &lt;ul&gt;,

73
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,322
for unordered list.

74
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:41,515
And I'll put in multiple list items here.

75
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,051
But I'll actually generate these on the fly,

76
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:44,662
using a JSP Scriptlet.

77
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:46,313
So notice the angle bracket percent,

78
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,417
and now I can write real Java code.

79
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:52,584
So here, what I want to do is use that request.getParameter.

80
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:57,226
And I want to getParameter, actually getParameterValues,

81
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:58,565
because it's gonna be multiple items

82
00:03:58,565 --> 00:04:00,431
that are gonna be returned.

83
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:03,348
And then I'll say favoriteLanguage.

84
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:08,781
Okay, good.

85
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,634
Now I actually have a syntax error here,

86
00:04:11,634 --> 00:04:14,414
because this method request.getParameterValues,

87
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:15,911
it returns an array, so I need to add

88
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:20,272
the square brackets here for an array, on line 14.

89
00:04:20,272 --> 00:04:21,719
That took care of that error.

90
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,707
So now I simply need to just do a for loop

91
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:27,963
through that array and, you know, display list items here.

92
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:29,924
So I'll setup this for loop.

93
00:04:29,924 --> 00:04:33,155
String tempLang, that's my temporary variable,

94
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:35,761
:langs is the actual array itself.

95
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:37,400
And then I simply do an out.println.

96
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,833
I just do li for list item.

97
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,257
And then I just append the tempLang.

98
00:04:42,257 --> 00:04:45,828
And then I just close off the /li.

99
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:49,465
So this is, basically, we're generating html on the fly

100
00:04:49,465 --> 00:04:51,001
with our JSP.

101
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,063
Which is a good little example here

102
00:04:52,063 --> 00:04:54,063
of using JSP Scriptlets.

103
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,830
Alright, so to recap here.

104
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,196
We read in all the parameter values,

105
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:03,806
and then we do the for loop,

106
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:06,345
and we print out all the list items.

107
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:09,845
Alright, so this looks really good so far.

108
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,059
Alright, so I'll save my file.

109
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:16,151
And now let's go ahead and run it,

110
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:17,097
so let's run the form.

111
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:19,587
So, our student-checkbox-form.html.

112
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:23,337
Just do a right-click, Run As, Run on Server.

113
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:28,195
Okay, great, so here's our form.

114
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,695
We can enter our first name and last name.

115
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:36,581
And then we can go through and choose the languages.

116
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,414
So now we can choose multiple languages here.

117
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:41,020
So I'll choose Java and C# just to start.

118
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,157
I'll hit submit.

119
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:43,502
And here it says student is confirmed,

120
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:45,798
and hey, there's our list, Java, C#.

121
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:47,999
Which looks okay, but I noticed I didn't put my little

122
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:51,771
description at the beginning of the favorite languages.

123
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:52,890
So let me just do that really quick.

124
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:55,314
So I'm back in my JSP right now.

125
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,855
And I'll just say favorite programming languages.

126
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:03,324
Just text so you can see it on the actual html page.

127
00:06:03,324 --> 00:06:06,258
Do my little br break there.

128
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:07,425
And save that.

129
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,350
Now when I go back to my forms,

130
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,157
click on back in the browser.

131
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:14,064
Then I can just choose

132
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:17,376
maybe a different language here, Ruby.

133
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:18,426
And hit submit.

134
00:06:18,426 --> 00:06:19,866
So now we have our little header,

135
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:20,954
our little description there,

136
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:23,271
along with whatever language they selected.

137
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,448
And also, I can just play around with it.

138
00:06:24,448 --> 00:06:26,988
I can add multiple languages here,

139
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:28,513
like maybe this PHP and Ruby.

140
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,430
Hit submit.

141
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:33,067
And we see those displayed here in the browser.

142
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,747
And then I can maybe just choose all of them,

143
00:06:34,747 --> 00:06:36,165
and see if this works.

144
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:36,998
And it does, right?

145
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,246
So it's simply reading those values,

146
00:06:38,246 --> 00:06:40,535
and doing a for loop, and walking through

147
00:06:40,535 --> 00:06:42,148
all of those items.

148
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:42,981
So this is really good.

149
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:45,881
So we're, I'd say we're successful.

150
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:48,833
So we had a html form with checkboxes.

151
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,093
And we read the data with JSP.

152
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,843
Very good, good job.
