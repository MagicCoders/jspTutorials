00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,723
<v ->Hey, in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:06,890
I'm going to show you how to use HTML forms and check boxes.

3
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:10,734
So, we'll cover the following topics.

4
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:13,218
We'll first start off with a check box demo.

5
00:00:13,218 --> 00:00:15,349
And then I'll show you the actual HTML code

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,206
for creating check boxes.

7
00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:18,977
And then we'll pull it all together

8
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,616
with a full JSP page example.

9
00:00:21,616 --> 00:00:23,592
Alright, so a lot of good things in store here,

10
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:26,092
lets go ahead and get started.

11
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,376
Alright, so lets start off with the check box demo here.

12
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:34,464
The user can enter their first name and last name.

13
00:00:34,464 --> 00:00:36,026
And now the new thing that's here,

14
00:00:36,026 --> 00:00:37,228
is that they can actually choose

15
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:39,353
multiple programming languages.

16
00:00:39,353 --> 00:00:41,802
So that's thanks to check boxes.

17
00:00:41,802 --> 00:00:43,683
Previously they could only use radio buttons

18
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:45,042
and choose only one language,

19
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:46,905
but now they can choose multiple languages.

20
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:48,536
Which is good, gives them more flexibility.

21
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:52,193
Because we may personally like more than one language.

22
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:53,325
And once you're happy with that,

23
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:55,914
you can go ahead and hit submit.

24
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:58,689
And now, our confirmation page is a little bit different.

25
00:00:58,689 --> 00:01:00,999
So now since they can choose multiple languages,

26
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:03,675
then we'll simply display a list of all of the languages

27
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:05,724
that they actually selected.

28
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:08,244
So we'll do some slightly different coding here

29
00:01:08,244 --> 00:01:10,194
on our confirmation pages.

30
00:01:10,194 --> 00:01:13,027
But that's the big picture anyway.

31
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:16,452
Alright, so lets go ahead and look at the code here

32
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,635
for HTML check boxes.

33
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:21,113
So, its very similar to radio buttons.

34
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:23,929
The only difference is the actual input type.

35
00:01:23,929 --> 00:01:25,403
So instead of type radio,

36
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:27,516
we say type equals checkbox.

37
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,745
And other than that, everything else stays the same.

38
00:01:29,745 --> 00:01:31,493
So, input type of checkbox,

39
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:32,706
name favorite language,

40
00:01:32,706 --> 00:01:34,012
value of Java,

41
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:35,980
with a label off to the far right.

42
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,640
And you can just repeat that process

43
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,543
for each one of the languages, C-sharp, PHP, and Ruby.

44
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:42,342
So again, very similar.

45
00:01:42,342 --> 00:01:46,259
The only thing new is the type equals checkbox.

46
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,394
Alright, so now that the user can check multiple boxes.

47
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,147
We need to change our coding up a little bit

48
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:53,586
in our JSP page.

49
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:54,939
So now on our JSP,

50
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:57,186
we won't be able to use the little shortcut syntax

51
00:01:57,186 --> 00:01:59,513
of the dollar sign, curly brace, param,

52
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:00,779
because now were going to get

53
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:02,259
a lot of different values back.

54
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,577
So what we can do instead

55
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:05,179
is make use of the request objects.

56
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:08,685
I'll say, request dot get parameter values

57
00:02:08,685 --> 00:02:11,988
and then I'll give the parameter name, favorite language.

58
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:14,548
So this get parameter values will actually return

59
00:02:14,548 --> 00:02:16,911
an array of strings.

60
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:18,037
Right? That makes sense right?

61
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,295
Because they can choose multiple programing languages now,

62
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:23,529
so it's going to return an array of strings.

63
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:26,222
And then it will write some JSP scriptlet code,

64
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:29,440
and we'll actually loop through that array and,

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,381
you know, print out an HTML list of the data.

66
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:34,047
But anyway, things will be a little different

67
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:35,904
when we get into the coding there of the JSP,

68
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,737
and we'll make use of this technique for that.

69
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:44,211
Alright, so lets kind of pull it all together.

70
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:47,932
So, for this demo, our project actually,

71
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:50,707
we're going to have a student checkbox form.

72
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:51,758
They can enter their information,

73
00:02:51,758 --> 00:02:53,409
choose multiple programming languages,

74
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:54,559
hit submit.

75
00:02:54,559 --> 00:02:56,974
Then that will go over to a JSP.

76
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,638
We'll give them their confirmation information,

77
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,978
and then we'll loop through all languages selected,

78
00:03:01,978 --> 00:03:05,867
and then display them as an HTML list.

79
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,386
Alright, so you know how I love to-do lists.

80
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:09,988
So, the first thing we have to do is,

81
00:03:09,988 --> 00:03:11,672
create the HTML form.

82
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:13,030
And then the second thing we'll do is,

83
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,445
create the JSP confirmation page.

84
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,053
And what I'll do, I'll actually break this up

85
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:18,829
and show it in a separate video.

86
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:20,426
As far as all the Eclipse coding.

87
00:03:20,426 --> 00:03:23,343
So, I'll see you in the next video.
