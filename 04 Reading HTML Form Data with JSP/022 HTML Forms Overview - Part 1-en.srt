1
00:00:01,356 --> 00:00:03,000
<v Instructor>In this video, I'm gonna show you how</v>

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,917
to make use of HTML forms with JSP.

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,407
We'll actually cover the following topics.

4
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:13,329
I'll first start off with a review of HTML forms,

5
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:16,287
then I'll show you how to build an HTML form.

6
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:20,312
Next, we'll learn how to read the form data with JSP.

7
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,724
All right, a lot of good stuff.

8
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,768
We've all used HTML forms before,

9
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:26,654
if you've gone to any website where you have to login

10
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:28,357
with user ID and password.

11
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:31,333
That information was entered via an HTML form.

12
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:33,792
Also, if you've gone on any travel site

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,889
and booked an airline trip or hotel reservation,

14
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:41,056
again, all of that data was entered through an HTML form.

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,877
What we're going to do here is we're gonna learn how

16
00:00:46,877 --> 00:00:49,637
to build an HTML form to read student information.

17
00:00:49,637 --> 00:00:50,696
We're gonna prompt the student

18
00:00:50,696 --> 00:00:52,951
for their first name and last name.

19
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:54,369
They'll enter it into a text field,

20
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,143
and then once they enter that data,

21
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:58,069
they'll hit the submit button.

22
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:00,517
Once they hit submit, that data will be sent over

23
00:01:00,517 --> 00:01:02,760
to a JSP page for processing.

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,902
We'll have a JSP page or read the form data

25
00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:07,629
for the first name and the last name,

26
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:12,220
and we'll send back the confirmation page to the browser.

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,693
I'll show you how to put all of this together.

28
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:15,195
We'll start with the form first,

29
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:17,968
and then we'll move into the actual JSP development.

30
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:20,385
All right, let's get started.

31
00:01:22,694 --> 00:01:25,088
Here's the coding here for the HTML form.

32
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:27,193
Again, we want to have an HTML form

33
00:01:27,193 --> 00:01:29,044
for the first name and last name,

34
00:01:29,044 --> 00:01:32,117
along with the submit button.

35
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:35,038
When you build an HTML form, you start off with the form tag

36
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,167
and then you specify the action.

37
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,824
You're basically telling the system where

38
00:01:38,824 --> 00:01:40,407
to send the form data.

39
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:43,170
We're telling the system here, "Send the form data

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,820
to student-response.jsp."

41
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,214
Next, we set up our text fields

42
00:01:47,214 --> 00:01:49,089
for first name and last name.

43
00:01:49,089 --> 00:01:51,907
So, for text field, we have input type="text",

44
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:54,407
we give name="firstName".

45
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:57,427
And that name's very important.

46
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,502
We'll need that name on the server side.

47
00:01:59,502 --> 00:02:01,597
We do a similar thing here for last name.

48
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:05,494
input type="text", name="LastName".

49
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:08,915
Finally, for our submit button, we set up an input type.

50
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:11,072
We say, "input type="submit",

51
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,414
and then we give the value of "Submit",

52
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,540
so the value portion here is really just the label

53
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,301
that you'll see on the submit button.

54
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,766
Once they hit the submit button,

55
00:02:19,766 --> 00:02:21,844
then that data will actually be sent over

56
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:25,427
to the appropriate JSP page for processing.

57
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:31,796
Here's the coding here for reading the form data.

58
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:34,131
Whenever we read the form data with the JSP,

59
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:36,755
it's very important that we need to know the names

60
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:39,300
of those HTML form fields.

61
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,657
I have these HTML form fields here on this slide

62
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:42,999
just for reference.

63
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,269
At the bottom, in the JSP file,

64
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,831
we simply want to say, "The student is confirmed",

65
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:49,614
and then we want to display the student's first name

66
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:50,937
and last name.

67
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,651
So we read the form data by saying "request.getParameter

68
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:58,818
and we give that form field name, ("firstName").

69
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:02,523
And then to read the last name, we do a similar thing.

70
00:03:02,523 --> 00:03:05,032
request.getParameter("lastName").

71
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:07,274
We place all that inside of a JSP expression

72
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:10,956
with the angle bracket, percent, with the equal symbol.

73
00:03:10,956 --> 00:03:14,956
That will allow us to read the form data in JSP.

74
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,693
Next, here's an alternate syntax for reading the form data.

75
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:24,715
You can make use of this dollar sign, curly brace,

76
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:28,241
and then you can say param.formFieldName.

77
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,677
So, a simpler way of writing this page is

78
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,113
The student is confirmed, and then we simply say

79
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,863
${param.firstName}, and a similar thing here,

80
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,724
${param.lastName}

81
00:03:41,557 --> 00:03:43,588
This is really just a shortcut method.

82
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:46,323
It's only used for displaying form data,

83
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:48,363
so it's really just a shorthand,

84
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:51,126
simpler way of writing the code.

85
00:03:51,126 --> 00:03:52,759
If you needed to read the form data

86
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,739
in maybe a scriplet or something,

87
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,478
you'd have to resort back to using the request.getParameter.

88
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,445
But as much as possible, I'll try

89
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:02,232
and make use of this shortcut method

90
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:04,399
in our confirmation pages.

91
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,117
This wraps up this portion of the video.

92
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,974
In the following video, I'll actually do a code demo,

93
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:15,457
and I'll take you to Eclipse, and we'll actually write

94
00:04:15,457 --> 00:04:16,649
the code in Eclipse.

95
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,232
I'll see you in the next video.
