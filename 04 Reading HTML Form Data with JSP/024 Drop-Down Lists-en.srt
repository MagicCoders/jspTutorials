00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:03,401
<v Instructor>Hello, in this video I'm gonna show you</v>

2
00:00:03,401 --> 00:00:07,068
how to build dropdown lists with HTML forms.

3
00:00:09,005 --> 00:00:10,940
So, we'll cover the following topics.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,967
First off we'll see dropdown lists in action

5
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:16,161
and then I'll show you the HTML code

6
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:18,389
to build a dropdown list

7
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:20,111
and finally, we'll pull it altogether

8
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:23,200
with a full JSP page example.

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,548
All right, so let's go ahead and get started.

10
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:29,369
So, first off, here's a dropdown list in action.

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,849
We have a student and they can select their country

12
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:33,832
and so, we can give them all the different options

13
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:35,006
of the countries here

14
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,979
and so, this is an example of a dropdown list

15
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:39,780
and I'll show you the HTML code

16
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,363
on how to build this type of dropdown list.

17
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:48,089
Okay, so let's look at the HTML code

18
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,001
for building a dropdown list.

19
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,335
So, basically you make use of a select tag,

20
00:00:53,335 --> 00:00:54,600
so here we have select

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,859
and we say name equals country

22
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:59,533
and then you drop in all the different options

23
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:01,662
that you'll have here for the dropdown list,

24
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,762
so here we have option&gt;Brazil,

25
00:01:03,762 --> 00:01:06,607
France, Germany, India and so on

26
00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:09,269
and this will actually help us build the dropdown list

27
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,936
for our application.

28
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:22,290
And note here where we have the select name equals country,

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,971
country, that's the name of the form filler

30
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:27,031
you use in your JSP page to read the form data

31
00:01:27,031 --> 00:01:31,063
and I'll show you that later in the demo.

32
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:32,458
All right, so let's pull it altogether.

33
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:34,420
So, we're going to have an HTML form

34
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,557
that's gonna request a student's name,

35
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:38,788
first, last and also their country.

36
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,940
They're gonna submit their form data

37
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,949
and then we're gonna have a JSP page

38
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:44,646
that'll actually process this

39
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,658
and we'll display the student's name

40
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:50,408
and also display the user's selected country.

41
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:56,584
So, I always like to have a to-do list,

42
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:57,666
so the first thing we're gonna do

43
00:01:57,666 --> 00:01:59,652
is we're gonna create an HTML form

44
00:01:59,652 --> 00:02:01,061
and then the second thing we'll do is build

45
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:03,587
the JSP confirmation page.

46
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:07,754
All right, let's move into Eclipse and try this out.

47
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,166
All right, so we're in Eclipse.

48
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,216 line:15% 
What I'd like to do is to continue to use

49
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,549 line:15% 
the existing project jspdemo

50
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:19,787 line:15% 
and what we're gonna do

51
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:21,707 line:15% 
is we're gonna actually gonna have a form.

52
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:24,579
So, the from is going to be very similar to the previous one

53
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:27,387
so I simply want to copy our previous form

54
00:02:27,387 --> 00:02:29,290
and use that as a starting point.

55
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,729
So, select student-from.html,

56
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:34,812
just do a right click and choose Copy

57
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,771
and then right click and choose paste.

58
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,456
We simply want to paste a copy of this,

59
00:02:42,456 --> 00:02:44,456
so I'll just do a paste.

60
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:48,221
And at this point

61
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:51,481
Eclipse will prompt you for a new name for the form,

62
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,268
so the name we're gonna use here

63
00:02:53,268 --> 00:02:55,768
is student-dropdown-form.html,

64
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:00,614
so student-dropdown-form.html,

65
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,863
that's the new name of our form.

66
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:05,183
And once you're happy with the name,

67
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:07,016
go ahead and click OK.

68
00:03:09,081 --> 00:03:11,365
Okay, great, so now we should have this new form here,

69
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,835
student-dropdown-form.html.

70
00:03:13,835 --> 00:03:15,243
Let's go ahead and open this form up

71
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:17,076
and take a look at it.

72
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:22,255
And I'll expand the window here for a second.

73
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:26,553
Okay, great, so the first thing we wanna do

74
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:29,331
is one line seven we wanna change the actual JSP page

75
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:30,492
it's gonna point to.

76
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:34,659
So, we want it to point to student-dropdown-response.jsp.

77
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:38,374
Again, student-dropdown-response.jsp.

78
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:41,196
That's the new page that we're gonna create in this video

79
00:03:41,196 --> 00:03:42,879
for actually processing the form data

80
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,796
from the dropdown list.

81
00:03:49,953 --> 00:03:51,333
Now everything else here is the same.

82
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:53,686
Let's move down to line 16

83
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:57,853
and first off, let's just do some white space here

84
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:03,908
and let's add in the actual tag for that dropdown list

85
00:04:03,908 --> 00:04:05,517
using the select tag,

86
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:08,767
so I'll say select names equals country

87
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,235
and now here I'll go through and I'll add

88
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:16,568
the different options for the countries.

89
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:26,347
So, start off with the first country here Brazil,

90
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:30,521
France,

91
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:36,159
Germany and just more of the same.

92
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,875
I'll just repeat this for all the other countries here,

93
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,476
I'll speed the video up just to list out

94
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:42,893
all the other countries here.

95
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,752
Okay, great, so these are all the countries

96
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:53,476
and this is our dropdown list.

97
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:55,379
So, this is great, this kind of what we wanted

98
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,183
to do for building the HTML dropdown list.

99
00:04:58,183 --> 00:04:59,516
Good job so far.

100
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:04,201
All right, so now let's go ahead

101
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:06,118
and work on our JSP page.

102
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:08,297
Again, our JSP page is gonna be very similar

103
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:10,253
to our previous page we created,

104
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:11,964
so we're simply going to copy it,

105
00:05:11,964 --> 00:05:14,352
so choose student-response.jsp,

106
00:05:14,352 --> 00:05:16,602
right click and choose Copy

107
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:23,738
and then do another right click and choose Paste.

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,499
And we'll give a new name for it here,

109
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,416
so we'll call it student-dropdown-response.jsp,

110
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:39,972
student-dropdown-response.jsp.

111
00:05:41,164 --> 00:05:43,770
We'll hit OK and now we have this new page

112
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,373
that was just created, student-dropdown-response.jsp.

113
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:51,540
Let's go ahead and double click this file and open it.

114
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:56,638
All right, so this had the very basic page confirmation

115
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,406
from the previous video

116
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,366
and now what we're gonna do

117
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:01,217
is just add information about reading

118
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:03,305
from that dropdown list,

119
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:06,058
that dropdown list with the name of country.

120
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:09,503
So, here I'll say the student's country

121
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,821
and I'll use that dollar sign, curly brace param.country

122
00:06:12,821 --> 00:06:15,898
and that will read the information from that dropdown list,

123
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:16,898
so good job.

124
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:21,948
All right, so let's go ahead and try this out,

125
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,238
so to test it we'll select our form,

126
00:06:25,238 --> 00:06:27,703
student-dropdown-form.html,

127
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:28,741
we'll do a right click

128
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:31,991
and we'll choose Run As, Run on Server.

129
00:06:35,047 --> 00:06:36,969
And this will bring up the form

130
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:41,011
and we can enter the user's first name and last name,

131
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:44,928
Ajay, Rao and we'll choose his country of India

132
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:51,570
and once we're happy with everything,

133
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,903
we'll hit the Submit button.

134
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:58,250
Okay, great, so we have the student's name

135
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,089
and also note here the student's country

136
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:03,923
and that's all based on us reading that dropdown list

137
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,309
from the JSP page, so good job,

138
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,726
we were successful with that.

139
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,779
All right, well, this wraps up the video.

140
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:17,228
In this video I showed you how to build a dropdown list

141
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,431
with HTMl forms

142
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:22,202
and also how to read that form data with JSP.

143
00:07:22,202 --> 00:07:23,035
Great job.
