1
00:00:01,514 --> 00:00:03,290
<v Voiceover>Alright so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,123
and move into Eclipse.

3
00:00:04,123 --> 00:00:05,615
What I'd like to do is to continue

4
00:00:05,615 --> 00:00:09,198
to use the same project as before, jspdemo.

5
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:13,333
And what I wanna do is move down to the

6
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,247
WebContent directory and create a new file.

7
00:00:16,247 --> 00:00:17,456
So we're actually gonna create a new file

8
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:19,572
for the html form.

9
00:00:19,572 --> 00:00:20,823
So I'll just do a right click,

10
00:00:20,823 --> 00:00:22,406
I'll say new, file.

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,206
The name of this file, I'll call it student-form.html.

12
00:00:31,103 --> 00:00:32,432
And once we're happy with the name we can

13
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,515
go ahead and click the Finish button.

14
00:00:39,198 --> 00:00:43,176
Alright, so let's go ahead and expand the window here.

15
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,468
Now I'll set up my basic html tags.

16
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:50,635
And then I'll set up a header for the title of this form.

17
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:52,602
And then we'll just go in and set up

18
00:00:52,602 --> 00:00:55,185
some body tags here real quick.

19
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,142
And then we can start building our form.

20
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:04,010
So here I'll say form action equals

21
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,827
student-response.jsp

22
00:01:05,827 --> 00:01:08,096
so that's the jsp file we're gonna send the data to.

23
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,001
We haven't created the file yet, we'll create it next.

24
00:01:10,001 --> 00:01:14,168
But that's the actual file that we'll send the data to.

25
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:16,690
Now I need to simply go through

26
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,725
and create some form fields.

27
00:01:18,725 --> 00:01:22,475
So I'll set up the form field for first name.

28
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:26,242
So the input type is text

29
00:01:26,242 --> 00:01:29,836
and the name is equal to first name.

30
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:31,583
And again that's the exact same name

31
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,408
we're gonna use on the server side in our jsp

32
00:01:33,408 --> 00:01:35,658
when we read the form data.

33
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:40,796
Just set up some line breaks here.

34
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:43,874
And now I'll do a similar thing here for last name.

35
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:45,935
So input type equals text.

36
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:47,768
Name equals last name.

37
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:56,075
I'll just do a quick copy paste here on the line breaks.

38
00:01:58,473 --> 00:01:59,975
And then finally to wrap it all up

39
00:01:59,975 --> 00:02:01,291
I'll set up my submit button.

40
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:04,901
So I'll say input type equals submit

41
00:02:04,901 --> 00:02:06,920
and then value equals submit.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,612
So the value of submit, that's the actual

43
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:12,195
label that you'll see on the submit button.

44
00:02:14,066 --> 00:02:16,278
Now I notice I have a typo on line 17.

45
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:20,355
I spelled the input type submt, I misspelled that one.

46
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:21,864
So let me fix that with an i.

47
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:22,697
Okay, good.

48
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:24,447
Now we're good to go.

49
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,540
Okay so this is the html form.

50
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,290
First name, last name, and the submit button.

51
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:38,001
Okay so now lets go ahead and create the jsp page

52
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:39,360
that'll process this.

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,947
So our student response jsp.

54
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:41,864
So new file

55
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,120
and I'll call it student-response.jsp.

56
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,616
That's the same name that I refer to in the html form.

57
00:02:52,616 --> 00:02:54,512
The student-response.jsp.

58
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:55,492
And once you're happy with this name

59
00:02:55,492 --> 00:02:57,508
you can go and click the Finish button.

60
00:02:57,508 --> 00:02:58,508
Okay, great.

61
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:02,336
So let's go ahead and set up our basic tags again.

62
00:03:02,336 --> 00:03:05,336
And set up our student confirmation.

63
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:09,475
And then take care of the body.

64
00:03:09,475 --> 00:03:10,498
Alright so now this is where we need

65
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:13,687
to start reading some of the form data.

66
00:03:13,687 --> 00:03:16,221
So first off I'll say "The student is confirmed"

67
00:03:16,221 --> 00:03:17,336
and then I wanna display their

68
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:18,408
first name an their last name.

69
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:20,363
So I'll make use of that shortcut notation.

70
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:23,946
The dollar sign curly brace param.firstName

71
00:03:24,907 --> 00:03:28,127
so its the same name from the html form

72
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:30,620
and then param.lastName.

73
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,086
So basically here we'll have first name,

74
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:37,253
space, last name for that student once they're registered.

75
00:03:39,003 --> 00:03:41,079
Alright so let's go ahead and run the program.

76
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,102
So I'll move over to student-form.html.

77
00:03:44,102 --> 00:03:47,557
I'll do a right click and I'll say Run As

78
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:50,057
and I'll choose Run on Server.

79
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,180
Okay great, so here's our form.

80
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,982
We can go ahead and enter some information here.

81
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:59,320
So for the first name I'll say John,

82
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,378
last name of Doe.

83
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:06,068
And once I'm happy with that I'll hit the Submit button.

84
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:08,380
Okay great, so here is our confirmation page.

85
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,458
The student is confirmed, John Doe.

86
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,891
So that's the result of us reading the form data

87
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:16,202
that the user entered on their html form.

88
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:18,574
So this all looks really good.

89
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:19,407
So good job.

90
00:04:19,407 --> 00:04:21,401
So we were successful in reading html

91
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,734
form data with the jsp page.
