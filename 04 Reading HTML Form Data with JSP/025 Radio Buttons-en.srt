00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:02,158
<v Narrator>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:03,448
In this video, I'm going to show you how

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:06,948
to to build HTML forms with radio buttons.

4
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:11,140
So we'll cover the following topics.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,956
First off, I'll start off with a radio button demo.

6
00:00:13,956 --> 00:00:16,322
Then we'll look at the actual HTML code

7
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,155
for building radio buttons

8
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:20,674
and finally we'll pull it all together

9
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:23,104
with a full JSP page example.

10
00:00:23,104 --> 00:00:24,556
So a lot of good things here.

11
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:27,139
Let's go ahead and get started.

12
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,556
All right, so here's the radio button demo.

13
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,913
So we'll have the student's first name and last name

14
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:35,315
but now we wanna have the student

15
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:38,087
choose their favorite programming language.

16
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:40,706
So here we'll give the first name and last name.

17
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:42,624
And then they can go through and select their language.

18
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:44,541
Java, PHP, C#, or Ruby.

19
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:48,375
Once they have their favorite language selected,

20
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:49,967
then they can go ahead and hit submit

21
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,581
and what we'll do is we'll actually generate

22
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:56,319
a confirmation page with the language that they selected.

23
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,483
So here I give the student's favorite programming language

24
00:00:58,483 --> 00:01:01,483
in this example, the user chose PHP.

25
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,217
So let's go ahead and look at the HTML here

26
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:08,547
for radio buttons.

27
00:01:08,547 --> 00:01:11,237
You'll set up your input type of radio,

28
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,595
and then you give the name,

29
00:01:12,595 --> 00:01:15,638
favorite language, and then the value "Java".

30
00:01:15,638 --> 00:01:18,943
And then an actual label for the user to see.

31
00:01:18,943 --> 00:01:20,811
And you repeat this for each one of the languages here

32
00:01:20,811 --> 00:01:23,000
for C#, PHP, and Ruby.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,292
So the key here is that the input type="radio".

34
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:29,459
And that will give you a radio button.

35
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:35,176
All right, so let's go ahead and pull it together

36
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:36,201
with an example.

37
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,495
So we'll have a student radio form where our user

38
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:40,689
will enter their information and they can choose

39
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,320
their favorite programming language,

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,601
they'll hit submit,

41
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:45,743
and it will go across to a JSP page

42
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:47,358
that will actually process it

43
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:51,525
and display the student's favorite programming language.

44
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:56,376
Okay, and as you know, I love to-do lists here.

45
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:59,490
So the first thing we have to do is create our HTML form

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,993
and then the second thing is create

47
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:03,021
the JSP confirmation page.

48
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,041
All right, so a lot of good things here.

49
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,708
Let's go ahead and start coding.

50
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:12,808
Okay, so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse.

51
00:02:12,808 --> 00:02:14,144
Just like all the previous videos,

52
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,801
we'll continue to use the same project, JSP demo.

53
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:20,217
And also like the previous video,

54
00:02:20,217 --> 00:02:21,829
we're gonna make use of the student form

55
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,232
as our starting point.

56
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:25,649
And we're gonna simply copy and rename it.

57
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:28,310
So I'll just right click on student-form.html

58
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,727
I'll select copy,

59
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:36,595
and then I'll right click on it and select paste.

60
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:39,624
And when I paste it I'm gonna give it a new name.

61
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:43,791
So the new name I'll call it a student-radio-form.html

62
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:50,809
and once I'm happy with that,

63
00:02:50,809 --> 00:02:54,142
I'll go ahead and click the okay button.

64
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:58,929
All right, so here's our form.

65
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,423
Student-radio-form.html

66
00:03:01,423 --> 00:03:03,395
lets go ahead and double click this

67
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:06,728
lets expand the window here for a second

68
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:09,868
and the first thing that we need to do on line 7

69
00:03:09,868 --> 00:03:12,112
is just update the response page

70
00:03:12,112 --> 00:03:16,149
so the response is gonna be student-radio-response.jsp

71
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:17,866
all right, we haven't created that page yet,

72
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:20,089
that's where we'll actually send the data

73
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:22,089
when we submit the form.

74
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:28,904
All right, so a lot of this stuff is frpm before.

75
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,237
What I'd like to do is go ahead and enter the HTML here

76
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:33,070
for the radio buttons.

77
00:03:35,271 --> 00:03:36,629
So I'll start off here with

78
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:39,379
the favorite programming language

79
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,637
and then I'll set up the input type

80
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:55,108
so the input type="radio"

81
00:03:59,585 --> 00:04:02,585
and the name="favoriteLanguage"

82
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:05,920
so that's the actual form fill name

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,819
and then the value="Java"

84
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,909
so this is for this given radio button.

85
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,969
And I also just put the label out there to the right.

86
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:16,073
And now what I can do is just copy this

87
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:20,240
x number of times for all of the other programming languages

88
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,251
so I'll just kind of speed the video up here real quick

89
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:28,668
and just update it for C#, PHP, and Ruby.

90
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:32,170
But now here's the end result.

91
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,088
So basically I have four radio buttons here

92
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,661
and they're for each one of

93
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:39,163
the different programming languages.

94
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:43,330
Now the key here again is the input type="radio".

95
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:48,070
Okay so this looks good so far.

96
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,013
So now let's go ahead and work on our JSP page.

97
00:04:51,013 --> 00:04:54,462
So again, we're simply gonna copy our student-response.jsp

98
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,136
from the previous video,

99
00:04:56,136 --> 00:04:58,052
and we'll simply rename it.

100
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,300
So I just right-click,

101
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,717
I'll choose copy,

102
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:03,918
and then I'll do a right click,

103
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:05,751
and I'll choose paste.

104
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:10,795
And for the new name I'll call it

105
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:13,045
student-radio-response.jsp.

106
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:23,315
And then I'll select okay.

107
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:30,416
Nice. So now we should have a new page here,

108
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,619
student-radio-response.jsp.

109
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:36,786
Let's go ahead and double click it and open it up.

110
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:40,429
I'll expand the window here for a second.

111
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:42,161
And let's go ahead and enter just

112
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:45,457
a little line break here for it.

113
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:47,277
And then I'll simply say

114
00:05:47,277 --> 00:05:51,360
The student's favorite programming language is x.

115
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:54,300
And that will be whatever the form data was supplied

116
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,133
so here I'll use the ${param.favoriteLanguage}

117
00:06:00,537 --> 00:06:01,492
and that's it.

118
00:06:01,492 --> 00:06:02,897
So that looks pretty good right now.

119
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:05,322
So this will basically read the form fill

120
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,572
for param.favoriteLanguage.

121
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:12,823
All right, so this look pretty good.

122
00:06:12,823 --> 00:06:14,548
So let's go ahead and run this application.

123
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,637
So, I'll move over to our form,

124
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:18,828
student-radio-form.html

125
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:20,239
I simply do a right click

126
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,327
I choose run as

127
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:24,122
and I choose run on server.

128
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:26,552
Okay, great. So here's our form.

129
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:31,045
We can enter the student's first name and last name.

130
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,340
And then our new piece here is

131
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,255
the actual radio buttons here.

132
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:37,781
So they choose either one of the programming languages

133
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:41,745
and then we could actually hit submit.

134
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:44,401
Okay, great. So here's our confirmation page.

135
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,294
So here's the student's favorite programming language.

136
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:48,170
And in this scenario,

137
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,274
they chose PHP.

138
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,477
But basically that's the result

139
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:53,998
of that form fill param.favoriteLanguage.

140
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,487
So we're successful here in writing a jsp

141
00:06:56,487 --> 00:06:59,154
for reading that form fill data.

142
00:07:02,641 --> 00:07:05,199
Okay, great, so let's go ahead and wrap up this video.

143
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,576
In this video I showed you how to build HTML forms

144
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:08,854
with radio buttons

145
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:12,812
and then also how to write jsp to read that form data.

146
00:07:12,812 --> 00:07:13,645
Good job.
