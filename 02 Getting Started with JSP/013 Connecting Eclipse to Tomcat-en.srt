<v Narrator>Hey, welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:04,255
In this video, I'm gonna show you

3
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:07,088
how to connect Eclipse and Tomcat.

4
00:00:09,126 --> 00:00:10,634
Now, the main benefit is that

5
00:00:10,634 --> 00:00:12,850
we can start Tomcat from Eclipse.

6
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:15,670
Also, it'll make it very easy for us to deploy

7
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,003
our web applications directly to Tomcat.

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,937
Alright, so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse.

9
00:00:22,937 --> 00:00:25,784
What I'd like to do is move down to the bottom section,

10
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,529
there's a tab called servers.

11
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:30,183
I'd like to click on that tab.

12
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:32,298
Now at this point, we don't have any servers

13
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,854
associated with our Eclipse environment at the time.

14
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:38,081
So what we need to do is click on this link,

15
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,982
and we're gonna add a new server.

16
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:41,523
And we're gonna add a new server that points

17
00:00:41,523 --> 00:00:45,106
to our Tomcat that we installed previously.

18
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:50,606
Alright, so here's the define new server.

19
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:51,873
What I need to do is move up

20
00:00:51,873 --> 00:00:55,456
to the Apache Tomcat folder, and expand it.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,946
Now, what I'd like to do is go ahead and click

22
00:01:12,946 --> 00:01:15,863
the next button here on the screen.

23
00:01:18,402 --> 00:01:20,697
And then at this point, I need to browse

24
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:24,241
and tell Eclipse where Tomcat is installed.

25
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,142
Alright, so wherever you have Tomcat installed,

26
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:28,032
you need to point to that directory.

27
00:01:28,032 --> 00:01:30,440
I'm gonna make use of the default directory

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,230
where Tomcat is installed.

29
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,538
It's under program files, Apache software, Tomcat 8.

30
00:01:36,538 --> 00:01:39,497
So this is the actual default directory

31
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:41,747
where Tomcat was installed.

32
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:50,646
Alright great, so once I have that selected,

33
00:01:50,646 --> 00:01:52,229
I'll click on okay.

34
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,281
And so it should give us the full path there

35
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,711
for the Tomcat installation directory.

36
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:59,930
So again, I'm just using the default.

37
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,798
Once I'm happy with this, I'll go ahead and click on next.

38
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:05,875
This screen here talks about some other apps,

39
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,316
don't worry about it, just go ahead and click on finish.

40
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:13,311
And this will associate Tomcat with the Eclipse environment,

41
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,844
so if everything is successful, down in the bottom center,

42
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,396
you should see a reference for Tomcat.

43
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:21,783
Now at this point, it's stopped, we haven't started it yet.

44
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:24,731
We'll actually start it in some of the following videos

45
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,556
when we start creating our web applications.

46
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:30,986
Okay, great, so if your Eclipse screen looks similar

47
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:32,819
to this, that means you're successful

48
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,565
in setting up Tomcat within Eclipse.

49
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:36,398
Good job.
