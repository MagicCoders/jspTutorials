1
00:00:01,198 --> 00:00:02,192
<v Instructor>Hey, welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:04,128
So, let's go ahead and get our hands dirty

3
00:00:04,128 --> 00:00:06,451
with setting up our development environment.

4
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:09,710
In this video I'm gonna show you how to install Tomcat

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,043
on the Mac operating system.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,259 line:15% 
All right, so what we need to do is to open up a web browser

7
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:20,303 line:15% 
and visit the Tomcat website,

8
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:23,386 line:15% 
so I need to go to tomcat.apache.org.

9
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,063 line:15% 
So, this will bring me to the main Apache Tomcat website.

10
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:32,674
This is where we can actually download the software,

11
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:34,244
so over on the left-hand side

12
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,224
there's a Download section

13
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:38,466
and it has the different versions of Tomcat

14
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:40,099
that we can download.

15
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:41,870
At the time of this video recording

16
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,970
the current version is Tomcat 8,

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,696
however, there may have a new version

18
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:48,755
and you can simply download the appropriate version,

19
00:00:48,755 --> 00:00:52,108
so I'll go ahead and select Tomcat 8 for this video

20
00:00:52,108 --> 00:00:55,506
and this will show me the Tomcat 8 downloads.

21
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:58,269
I'll just scroll down a bit

22
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:00,877
and I'll move down to the binary distributions,

23
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:04,794
that means this is the binary code or whatever.

24
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,451
Since I'm doing this for a Mac

25
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:10,492
I'll go ahead and choose tar.gz,

26
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:11,602
so it's simply a zip file

27
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:14,485
that preserves the file permissions

28
00:01:14,485 --> 00:01:17,647
and I'll select the link here.

29
00:01:17,647 --> 00:01:20,541
My browser's going to prompt me for the actual file

30
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,386
and I'll say save the file and I'll hit OK

31
00:01:23,386 --> 00:01:26,437
and so, this will actually download the Tomcat file

32
00:01:26,437 --> 00:01:28,187
to my local computer.

33
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:32,268
All right, great, so we've actually downloaded

34
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:33,859
the file to our file system,

35
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:35,795
so let me go over and open up my finder.

36
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,152 line:15% 
Let me move into the Downloads directory

37
00:01:38,152 --> 00:01:39,902 line:15% 
and this is where I'll find the actual file

38
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:41,094 line:15% 
that was just downloaded,

39
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:43,723 line:15% 
so here apache-tomcat-8.

40
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:46,085 line:15% 
Now what I need to do is actually unzip the file,

41
00:01:46,085 --> 00:01:48,906 line:15% 
so I can actually unzip it by double clicking it,

42
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:51,970 line:15% 
so I'll go ahead and do that now

43
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,657
and now I have this folder here

44
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,015
for apache-tomcat-8,

45
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:59,119
so this is the unzipped version of the file.

46
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,685
All right, so what I normally like to do

47
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:02,968
is actually move this into another directory

48
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:04,652 line:15% 
so I can make use of it,

49
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:07,759 line:15% 
so we'll actually make use of a directory

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,056 line:15% 
for this training class

51
00:02:10,056 --> 00:02:13,041 line:15% 
and I'll call it jsf-for-beginners,

52
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,375 line:15% 
so let me go and open up a new window here.

53
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,270 line:15% 
I'll move down to the bottom

54
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,187
and I'll say New Folder

55
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:24,880
and I'll call it jsf-for-beginners,

56
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,756
so this is really just like

57
00:02:25,756 --> 00:02:28,589
a little empty scratch temp folder

58
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:32,092
that we're gonna use for this training class.

59
00:02:32,092 --> 00:02:33,972
I'll put all of our apps in here,

60
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,613
all of our servers and so forth,

61
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,641
so just one central location.

62
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,141
Jsf-for-beginners.

63
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:43,484
So, it's empty now, I'll just double click moving to it

64
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:45,739 line:15% 
and what I'd like to do is that folder

65
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:48,764 line:15% 
that I just expanded up top, tomcat-8,

66
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:52,250 line:15% 
I'll just grab it, drag and drop it into this new folder,

67
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,252 line:15% 
jsf-for-beginners, so all I do is just copy

68
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:56,580 line:15% 
that expanded directory

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,855 line:15% 
to this new folder jsf-for-beginners.

70
00:02:59,855 --> 00:03:02,522
Okay, so this looks pretty good.

71
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,815
All right, so now that I have a file extracted,

72
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:10,755
I actually want to verify the Tomcat installation

73
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:12,511
by actually running the server,

74
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:15,160
so what I'll do is I'll open up a terminal window here

75
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,275
and what I'd like to do is actually move

76
00:03:17,275 --> 00:03:20,608
into that Tomcat installation directory.

77
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,307 line:15% 
So, I'll just do a CD,

78
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:26,060 line:15% 
I'll move into that jsf-for-beginners

79
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,415 line:15% 
that we just created

80
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,231 line:15% 
and then the apache-tomcat directory

81
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,314 line:15% 
that we just copied over.

82
00:03:34,478 --> 00:03:36,291 line:15% 
All right, great, so I'm in the directory,

83
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,403 line:15% 
now I'll just do an ls just to see the contents

84
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,820
of this directory

85
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,975
and we'll see that this directory

86
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:47,167
has a startup.sh, this is in the bin directory,

87
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,222
startup.sh, this is what I'll use

88
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:51,335
to actually start the Tomcat server,

89
00:03:51,335 --> 00:03:52,847
so on my command line here

90
00:03:52,847 --> 00:03:56,186
I'll type in bin/startup.sh

91
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:59,088
and this will actually start the Tomcat server for me,

92
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:00,557
so we can see some logs

93
00:04:00,557 --> 00:04:02,232
and then we'll see in the bottom left

94
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:04,617
Tomcat started, so this is really good,

95
00:04:04,617 --> 00:04:06,208
so our server's installed

96
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,294
and we also started the server,

97
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:10,819
so at this point Tomcat is up and running

98
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,569
and it's listening for a request.

99
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,095
All right, great, so now that our server's running,

100
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,404
we can actually access our server,

101
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:27,223
so in my browser I can simply type local host:8080

102
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:29,817
and this will connect to my Tomcat server.

103
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:32,799
By default Tomcat is listening on port 8080

104
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:34,245
and that's how we connect to it,

105
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:37,404
so here we make it to a page Tomcat

106
00:04:37,404 --> 00:04:39,330
with the version number and then they'll even tell you hey,

107
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,488
if you're seeing this page,

108
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,807
you've successfully installed Tomcat,

109
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:44,066
so we're in really good shape here,

110
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:47,108
so we downloaded the server,

111
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:50,777
we installed it and we also started the server

112
00:04:50,777 --> 00:04:53,018
and then we accessed it via our web browser,

113
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,065
so we know that things are looking really good for us,

114
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:56,648
so good job so far.

115
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:02,464
And one final thing we wanna do

116
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:04,464
is actually stop the server

117
00:05:04,464 --> 00:05:05,739
or shut down the server

118
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:08,255
because later on we're gonna us it via Eclipse,

119
00:05:08,255 --> 00:05:12,365
so in our bin directory we can say just bin/shutdown.sh

120
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:15,059
and that will actually stop the Tomcat server

121
00:05:15,059 --> 00:05:17,786
but don't worry, once we install Eclipse,

122
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:21,953
then we'll actually Tomcat from the Eclipse server.

123
00:05:25,796 --> 00:05:27,974
All right, so we did a lot of good things in this video.

124
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:30,233
So, I showed you how to install the Tomcat server

125
00:05:30,233 --> 00:05:31,941
on a Mac operating system.

126
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:34,530
We went through the process to actually start the server

127
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,976
and also accessed the server

128
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:39,653
and then finally, how to stop the server,

129
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,212
so we're in good books now

130
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:44,795
that we have successfully installed Tomcat.
