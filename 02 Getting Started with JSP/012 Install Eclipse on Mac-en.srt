00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:02,534
<v Narrator>In this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,534 --> 00:00:05,296
I'm gonna show you how to install Eclipse on the Mac.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,888
In particular, we're going to install

4
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:08,920
the Java EE version of Eclipse.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,003
Okay, let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:15,047 line:15% 
Alright, so the first thing we need to do

7
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,629 line:15% 
is download Eclipse.

8
00:00:16,629 --> 00:00:20,006 line:15% 
So in our browser, we'll just visit eclipse.org.

9
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,987 line:15% 
This'll bring us to the Eclipse website

10
00:00:21,987 --> 00:00:24,483
and over on the far right is a Download button.

11
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,165
Let's go ahead and click on that button,

12
00:00:26,165 --> 00:00:29,582
and this'll take us to the download page.

13
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:33,585
Alright, so now we're at the download page,

14
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:35,268
let's scroll down a bit

15
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:38,032
and we wanna make use of the Eclipse IDE

16
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:39,930
for Java EE Developers,

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,430
so it's really important, Java EE version.

18
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:50,335
So let's go ahead and click on the download link here,

19
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:53,215
I'm using a Mac right now so I'll download that version.

20
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:55,890
This'll take us to the download page,

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,601
I'll go ahead and click the option here

22
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:59,601
for the download mirror.

23
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:04,790
The browser will prompt me to download the file,

24
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,566
I'll go ahead and click Okay.

25
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,078
And then we'll start downloading it to our system.

26
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,432
Now this will take a while,

27
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:12,782
so what I'll do is I'll kind of step away

28
00:01:12,782 --> 00:01:16,865
and I'll come back once the download is complete.

29
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:21,752 line:15% 
Alright, so we've downloaded the file.

30
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:24,125 line:15% 
Now what we need to do is unzip Eclipse.

31
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,134 line:15% 
So the first thing I'll do

32
00:01:25,134 --> 00:01:26,813 line:15% 
is I'll move into the Downloads directory,

33
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:28,525 line:15% 
and there's the file that we just downloaded,

34
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:30,308 line:15% 
the Eclipse Jave EE,

35
00:01:30,308 --> 00:01:34,475 line:15% 
and I'll go ahead and double click this file to unzip it.

36
00:01:36,884 --> 00:01:38,748
Alright, so now what I'd like to do,

37
00:01:38,748 --> 00:01:40,554
now that this file is unzipped,

38
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:42,069
what I'd like to do is move it

39
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,764
to my jsf-for-beginners folder

40
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:47,067
that I created in a previous video.

41
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:49,970
So let me go ahead and open up a new Finder window here,

42
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,553
just resize the windows give me one second.

43
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:58,039
So at the bottom I have my jsf-for-beginners,

44
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,063
that's the one we created in our previous Mac video,

45
00:02:01,063 --> 00:02:02,416
I'll go ahead and double click in there

46
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:03,701
and that's where we installed our Tomcat

47
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,281
from the previous video.

48
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,851
I'll take this Eclipse folder that I just unzipped

49
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:11,274
and I'll move it down to that jsf-for-beginners folder.

50
00:02:11,274 --> 00:02:13,242
Again, this jsf-for-beginners folder

51
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:15,986
is just a little scratch sample folder

52
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:18,234
that we're going to use for our jsf class,

53
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:20,602
just to keep everything in one location.

54
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:22,994
But good, we just simply moved that from Downloads

55
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:26,327
over to our jsf-for-beginners. Good job.

56
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:30,152
Alright, so now that we have the file

57
00:02:30,152 --> 00:02:32,971
in our jsf-for-beginners directory,

58
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:34,753
let's go ahead and run Eclipse.

59
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:36,473
So I'll simply select the Eclipse icon

60
00:02:36,473 --> 00:02:37,751
in this Eclipse folder,

61
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:38,970
and I'll just double-click it

62
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,872
and this will start up Eclipse for me.

63
00:02:41,872 --> 00:02:44,767
So I'll go ahead and hit Open to start it to run.

64
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:46,712
And then they're gonna prompt me for a workspace.

65
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:48,127
So our workspace is simply a folder

66
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:49,614
where we put our sample code,

67
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:51,359
normally I would keep the defaults,

68
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,992
but in this example I'm going to change it.

69
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:55,409
So I'm gonna click on Browse,

70
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:02,755
and I'll move over to this jsf-for-beginners directory,

71
00:03:02,755 --> 00:03:03,858
and then in the bottom left

72
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:06,849
I'm gonna click on a button there for a New Folder,

73
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:09,839
and for New Folder I'll just type in the name of workspace.

74
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,747
So I'll create a new workspace folder here

75
00:03:11,747 --> 00:03:14,274
in jsf-for-beginners.

76
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:16,467
Hit Okay, and so this is what the layout

77
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:18,407
should look like once we have that set up.

78
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,474
So again, you can put your workspace anywhere you like,

79
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:23,305
but I'm just putting it here in this one directory

80
00:03:23,305 --> 00:03:25,153
just so it keeps track of everything else

81
00:03:25,153 --> 00:03:27,618
for this jsf-for-beginners class.

82
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:29,321
Alright, so once I'm happy with that I'll go ahead

83
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:31,689
and hit on Okay, and Eclipse will start running,

84
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,657
and then I'll make it to the Welcome screen.

85
00:03:33,657 --> 00:03:34,908
I always like to verify

86
00:03:34,908 --> 00:03:37,139
that I'm using the Java EE version of Eclipse,

87
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:39,532
because it has built-in support for jsf

88
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:41,533
and I'll go ahead and close this welcome.

89
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,103
Over on the left hand side I have my Project Explorer,

90
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:47,511
right now it's empty, nothing's there.

91
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:48,344
So that's it.

92
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:50,118
So at this point we have Eclipse installed

93
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:52,767
and we're able to run it and everything looks really good.

94
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:54,100
Good job so far.

95
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:57,132
Alright so this wraps up the video.

96
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,499
In this video I showed you how to install Eclipse

97
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:02,217
on the Mac, I also showed you how to download the file,

98
00:04:02,217 --> 00:04:04,967
unzip it and then launch Eclipse.
