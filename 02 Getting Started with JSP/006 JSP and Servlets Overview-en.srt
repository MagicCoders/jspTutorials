00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,121
<v Voiceover>Welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:02,121 --> 00:00:04,282
In this video, I'm gonna give you an overview

3
00:00:04,282 --> 00:00:05,949
of JSP and Servlets.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,493
We'll cover the following topics.

5
00:00:10,493 --> 00:00:13,314
We'll first find out what is a Web Application.

6
00:00:13,314 --> 00:00:15,956
Then we'll learn about JSP and Servlets

7
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:18,825
and finally, I'll show you different types of apps

8
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:21,908
you can create with JSP and Servlets.

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,137
So what we're gonna do in this course

10
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:26,247
is we're gonna build web applications.

11
00:00:26,247 --> 00:00:28,678
So you may wonder, oh, what is a web application?

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,038
We'll you've used this before.

13
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:31,932
If you have gone to any e-commerce site

14
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,630
like Amazon or any travel site,

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,256
you've used a web app and it's basically a site

16
00:00:36,256 --> 00:00:38,648
that builds HTML pages on the fly

17
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:41,003
based on your user actions.

18
00:00:41,003 --> 00:00:43,048
So I'd like to show you and example of this

19
00:00:43,048 --> 00:00:45,548
using one of the travel sites.

20
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:50,753
So here's expedia.com, I use this site a lot for travel.

21
00:00:50,753 --> 00:00:53,636
I travel a lot from Philadelphia to India.

22
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,024
So, here I'll enter my, where I'm flying from,

23
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,409
where I'm flying to.

24
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,894
I'll enter some dates here for my travel,

25
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,339
and then the key here is that once I hit Search,

26
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:06,042
it's actually gonna generate HTML pages

27
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:08,215
for me based on my request.

28
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:10,008
All right, so these pages that you see here,

29
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,470
it's not a hard-coded page.

30
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,794
It's actually generated on the fly based on my input,

31
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:19,461
Philadelphia going to Bangalore.

32
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,980
All right, so you may wonder what happens behind the scenes.

33
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,204
Well, behind the scenes in the web browser,

34
00:01:26,204 --> 00:01:29,874
you select search flights, then it goes to the web server.

35
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:31,606
What the web server would do is it'll actually

36
00:01:31,606 --> 00:01:34,877
submit a request to the Database using SQL.

37
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:37,352
And then once it has results, then it'll take

38
00:01:37,352 --> 00:01:41,518
that information and then send back an HTML page on the fly.

39
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,613
And that's the idea of a web application.

40
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:45,200
And this is actually very generic.

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,083
You can build web apps using any type of technology,

42
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:52,118
such as JSP or Servlets or dotnet technologies

43
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:55,277
or PHP technologies and so on.

44
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:56,594
But that's the basic idea.

45
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:58,095
And what I'll do in this course

46
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,786
is I'll show you a very high level

47
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,777
on how to get started with JSP for building pages.

48
00:02:03,777 --> 00:02:04,956
So that's the next question here,

49
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:07,136
what are JSPs and Servlets?

50
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:10,742
We'll, a JSP and Servlet, they're basically Java code

51
00:02:10,742 --> 00:02:12,772
that runs on the web server.

52
00:02:12,772 --> 00:02:16,507
So, they can read user input, normally from an HTML Form.

53
00:02:16,507 --> 00:02:18,130
And then they can perform the work,

54
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,719
maybe talking to a Database,

55
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:22,099
talking to a web service or whatever.

56
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:24,635
And finally, it'll return an HTML page

57
00:02:24,635 --> 00:02:28,091
that is generated dynamically on the fly.

58
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,732
So, kinda pulling it together with this big picture,

59
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:35,530
our Servelts and JSPs could actually run on the web server.

60
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,626
So they could read information for flight information,

61
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,535
send information or so with the Database,

62
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,355
get the results and then send back an HTML page.

63
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:47,432
So, that's kinda the area of where Servlets and JSPs

64
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:51,930
can fit in your web application architecture.

65
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,313
All right, so here's another frequently asked question.

66
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:56,941
Well, what types of apps can we create?

67
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,319
Well, I always like to say that you

68
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,606
can create apps for any industry.

69
00:03:00,606 --> 00:03:03,696
So, you can build e-commerce apps, you could build maybe

70
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:06,286
a student or employee tracking application.

71
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,774
If you're building like a hotel or restaurant

72
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:11,469
reservation app or a social media app,

73
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:13,106
like Twitter or Facebook.

74
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,737
Really, any type of app.

75
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:18,646
There's really no limit on the apps that you can create.

76
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:20,801
JSP and Servlets are the key components

77
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,570
of the Java Enterprise Edition.

78
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,493
They're the most popular pieces of technology

79
00:03:24,493 --> 00:03:26,675
and I always like to say they're the bread and butter

80
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:28,913
because a lot of popular MVC frameworks

81
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,035
actually use JSP and Servlets.

82
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:34,976
So, for example, Spring, JSF and Struts.

83
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:38,513
They all use JSP and Servlets at the low level.

84
00:03:38,513 --> 00:03:40,229
Now, when you're using these technologies,

85
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,245
you may not see it directly at the high level

86
00:03:43,245 --> 00:03:46,323
but behind the scenes, Spring, JSF and Struts,

87
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:48,786
they all make use of JSP and Servlets.

88
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,484
So, they're the key components

89
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,209
of the Java Enterprise Edition.

90
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:54,295
So, by you understanding JSP,

91
00:03:54,295 --> 00:03:56,454
this'll help you when you move forward,

92
00:03:56,454 --> 00:04:00,506
if you use some of those frameworks later on in your career.

93
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,934
All right, so let's go ahead and wrap up this video.

94
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:05,001
So we defined what are web applications,

95
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:06,654
we saw a demo of a web app,

96
00:04:06,654 --> 00:04:09,017
we also discussed JSP and Servlets,

97
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:11,618
and then finally, we discussed the various types of apps

98
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:14,618
you can create with this technology.
