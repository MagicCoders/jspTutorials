1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:02,410
<v Narrator>Hey, welcome back!</v>

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,455
So let's go ahead and get our hands dirty.

3
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:06,112
So in this video, I'm gonna show you

4
00:00:06,112 --> 00:00:09,695
how to install Tomcat on Microsoft Windows.

5
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:13,725
Alright, so the first thing we need to do

6
00:00:13,725 --> 00:00:15,844
is we need to download Tomcat.

7
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:18,084
So in my browser, I'm gonna visit

8
00:00:18,084 --> 00:00:19,584
tomcat.apache.org.

9
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:27,114
And so this'll take me to the Tomcat website.

10
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:29,635
Over on the left-hand side is a downloads section,

11
00:00:29,635 --> 00:00:33,802
where we can actually download some of the software.

12
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:41,851
I'll move down to the section

13
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:44,397
for binary distributions, and I'll choose this

14
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:48,373
32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer.

15
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,650
So this is the normal MSI file.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:54,486
It'll install Tomcat as a Windows service.

17
00:00:54,486 --> 00:00:57,653
So I'll go ahead and select this link,

18
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:02,952
and right now my browser will start

19
00:01:02,952 --> 00:01:05,702
downloading it to my file system.

20
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:10,517
Alright, great. So now we have it downloaded.

21
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:13,458
Let's go ahead and open up a Windows Explorer,

22
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:16,802
and I'll move into this "Downloads" folder,

23
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:18,968
and there's the file that was just downloaded:

24
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:22,691
Apache Tomcat. So that's the actual installer.

25
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,462
So let's go ahead and run this installer

26
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:26,637
just by double-clicking it.

27
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:30,804
So this'll start up the installer. I'll hit "Yes."

28
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:35,781
And here I'm at the first step of the Wizard.

29
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:39,178
I'll go ahead and click "Next." I'll agree.

30
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:42,056
And then, here we choose our components.

31
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:43,713
For the components I like to choose "Full,"

32
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:46,238
just so I can get all the examples in the host manager.

33
00:01:46,238 --> 00:01:48,646
Again, a nice thing about this Tomcat installer

34
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:50,648
is that it installs it as a service,

35
00:01:50,648 --> 00:01:52,389
so I'll make sure that the service thing

36
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,668
is enabled or checked there.

37
00:01:54,668 --> 00:01:56,328
I'll go ahead and hit "Next."

38
00:01:56,328 --> 00:01:59,397
By default, Tomcat listens on port 8080.

39
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:02,112
Feel free to change that, but I like to keep the defaults.

40
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,736
And then you can set up a administrator login.

41
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,918
So for now, I'll just say "admin" "admin."

42
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:10,286
Again, you can give any username and password that you want.

43
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:12,369
And then I'll hit "Next."

44
00:02:13,786 --> 00:02:17,953
I'll accept the default installation here for my JRE.

45
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,698
I'll hit "Next."

46
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:23,480
And I'll also accept the default installation directory.

47
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,473
You can feel free to change this, but I'll go ahead

48
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:28,418
and keep the default installation directory for Tomcat.

49
00:02:28,418 --> 00:02:30,770
And then I'll hit "Install."

50
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:31,995
And so, at this point, it'll go through

51
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:34,113
the process of installing the software.

52
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:37,372
And now it says, "Hey, the software's installed."

53
00:02:37,372 --> 00:02:39,887
I'll turn off the option to show the readme.

54
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,025
I'll hit "Finish."

55
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:42,820
And now it'll actually start Tomcat

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,570
as a Windows service.

57
00:02:47,273 --> 00:02:48,959
Alright, great. So Tomcat is started.

58
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,070
Let's go ahead and verify our installation.

59
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,999
And we can verify it by viewing a website, localhost:8080.

60
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:59,166
That's where our local Tomcat server's running right now.

61
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:01,441
So if everything works out right,

62
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:03,393
it should bring up this page that you see here.

63
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:06,515
So it'll say "Apache Tomcat."

64
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:08,195
And then, also, they even give you a message,

65
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:10,046
"If you're seeing this, you've successfully

66
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:12,456
"installed Tomcat. Congratulations!"

67
00:03:12,456 --> 00:03:13,535
So we know that we're okay.

68
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:15,914
So Tomcat was installed successfully,

69
00:03:15,914 --> 00:03:20,453
and Tomcat is up and running. So good job so far.

70
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:21,671
Now I'm going to show you one other thing can do

71
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,769
is you can actually configure Tomcat.

72
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:24,763
So you can just right-click on

73
00:03:24,763 --> 00:03:28,377
the little Tomcat icon in the bottom-right.

74
00:03:28,377 --> 00:03:31,710
And say right-click and hit "Configure."

75
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,269
And this'll bring up the configuration window for Tomcat.

76
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:38,400
So you can change, like, the display name

77
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,921
for the service, you can change the actual description.

78
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:43,636
At the bottom it shows you if the status,

79
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:45,801
if it's running or stopped.

80
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,632
You can play around with some logging stuff.

81
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:49,229
A lot of other things you can play around with.

82
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,373
But for right now I'll just go ahead

83
00:03:50,373 --> 00:03:52,403
and keep everything as the defaults,

84
00:03:52,403 --> 00:03:55,486
and I'll just hit "Cancel" right now.

85
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:58,074
Another nice thing's that you can actually

86
00:03:58,074 --> 00:04:02,157
administer Tomcat via the Services control panel.

87
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:12,556
So I'll go ahead and click on "Services" here,

88
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:14,603
it'll bring it up, and we'll see in the list

89
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:17,744
we have Apache Tomcat that's listed as a service

90
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:20,687
and it's currently running.

91
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,207
So, just like any standard service,

92
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:24,262
you can just right-click, you can stop it,

93
00:04:24,262 --> 00:04:26,367
pause it, resume it, restart it;

94
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:30,031
you can do all the normal things you can do with a service.

95
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:32,738
What I'd like to do now is actually stop Tomcat,

96
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:35,331
because we're gonna run it later via Eclipse.

97
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:37,145
So I'll go ahead and stop this service.

98
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:40,974
I'll just do a right-click, I'll hit "Stop,"

99
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:42,101
and it'll go through the process

100
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,827
of stopping the Tomcat server.

101
00:04:43,827 --> 00:04:45,875
So right now it's not running. But don't worry.

102
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,015
Later on we'll actually hook up Tomcat

103
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:49,790
and Eclipse to run together,

104
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,615
and we'll cover that in one of the following videos.

105
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:57,991
Now, we were successful, we were able to download Tomcat

106
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,416
and install it, and then, also go through the process

107
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,131
of verifying our installation.

108
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:03,592
And then finally, we went around

109
00:05:03,592 --> 00:05:05,355
and took a look at some of the configs,

110
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:08,282
and also looked at the Services control panel.

111
00:05:08,282 --> 00:05:09,865
So good job so far.
