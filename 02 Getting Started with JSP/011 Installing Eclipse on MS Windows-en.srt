00:00:01,424 --> 00:00:02,646
<v Instructor>Hey, welcome back.</v>

2
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:03,479
In this video,

3
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:05,625
I'm gonna show you how to install Eclipse

4
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,375
on Microsoft Windows.

5
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:13,192
So the first thing we need to do is download Eclipse.

6
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:17,192
So we can go to the Eclipse website eclipse.org.

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:19,125
So in my browser,

8
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,685
I already have a little shortcut set up

9
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:23,268
that'll take us to eclipse.org.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,583
Now, once we're here,

11
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,144
this is the main Eclipse website

12
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:30,644
or the main Eclipse home page.

13
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,760
And what I'd like to do is move over to the right-hand side.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,138
There's a download button.

15
00:00:41,138 --> 00:00:43,053
I'd like to go ahead and click this download button

16
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:46,386
so it can take me to the downloads page.

17
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:58,965
All right, cool.

18
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:00,217
So now I'm at the downloads page.

19
00:01:00,217 --> 00:01:02,819
They have a lot of different distributions of Eclipse.

20
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,063
You wanna make sure that you choose the right one.

21
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:08,246
So if we scroll down the page here,

22
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:09,684
I'll show you that you wanna make use

23
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:11,601
of the Java EE package.

24
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:15,505
All right, so that's the one that's listed here,

25
00:01:15,505 --> 00:01:18,530
Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.

26
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,004
That's the one that we want.

27
00:01:20,004 --> 00:01:22,192
It's very important that you select this distribution

28
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:26,359
because it has built-in support for Java web applications.

29
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:32,051
All right, so over on the far right,

30
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:33,279
you can go ahead and download it.

31
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:36,029
So I have a 64-bit Windows operating system here.

32
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,452
I'll go ahead and select the link,

33
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:41,186
and it'll take me to the list of download options here.

34
00:01:41,186 --> 00:01:43,013
So again, this is one intermediate step,

35
00:01:43,013 --> 00:01:45,498
but you basically just go over to the left-hand side

36
00:01:45,498 --> 00:01:47,895
and choose that download link.

37
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:50,337
And this'll actually start downloading Eclipse

38
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:51,754
to your computer.

39
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,283
So they'll prompt us.

40
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,533
We'll say Save.

41
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:02,882
And this'll actually kinda start the download process.

42
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:05,182
And then at the bottom,

43
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:07,714
you'll see your browser will start downloading it.

44
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:09,350
This'll take a while to download

45
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,068
depending on your internet speed,

46
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:15,151
and I'll come back once the download is complete.

47
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,253
All right, so the download's complete.

48
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:21,403
Now we need to unzip Eclipse.

49
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:23,572
So I'm gonna open up my Windows Explorer.

50
00:02:23,572 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm gonna move into the Downloads directory.

51
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,551
This is where the file was actually downloaded.

52
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:29,791
So in Downloads,

53
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,391
there's a file here called eclipse-jee

54
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:35,242
depending on the version number that you have.

55
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:37,301
So that's the file that was just downloaded

56
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:38,610
from the Eclipse website.

57
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,939
And what I'd like to do is unzip this file.

58
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:42,415
So I can do a right-click,

59
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:44,099
I'll say Extract All,

60
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,471
and then we'll need to tell it where to extract Eclipse

61
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:47,597
or install Eclipse.

62
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:49,863
So here I'm just gonna use the C drive,

63
00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:51,251
so C colon backslash.

64
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:53,563
So it's gonna install it to the root of the C drive,

65
00:02:53,563 --> 00:02:57,425
and it's gonna install it in a folder called eclipse.

66
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:59,826
So once you're happy with the C colon backslash,

67
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,347
you can click Extract.

68
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,337
And actually, you can install it wherever you'd like,

69
00:03:03,337 --> 00:03:04,865
but here, just to keep things simple,

70
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,115
I'll put it at the C drive.

71
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,873
All right, great.

72
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:15,022
So now we've extracted it to the C drive.

73
00:03:15,022 --> 00:03:18,366
So I'll go over to Local Disk C drive,

74
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,279
and there's a new folder here called eclipse.

75
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:23,155
That's where the code was placed.

76
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:24,604
And I can move in here,

77
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:27,501
and then there's a Eclipse application

78
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,445
with the little icon there.

79
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:29,507
I can double-click this.

80
00:03:29,507 --> 00:03:31,749
This'll actually run Eclipse,

81
00:03:31,749 --> 00:03:33,251
and it'll start up Eclipse,

82
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,834
and it'll start running for us.

83
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:39,028
Oh, and I forgot,

84
00:03:39,028 --> 00:03:39,970
there's one thing.

85
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,500
Eclipse'll always prompt you to select a workspace.

86
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,072
So the workspace is basically a folder

87
00:03:45,072 --> 00:03:47,988
where you'll store your actual source code or projects.

88
00:03:47,988 --> 00:03:49,328
You can give it any name you want

89
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:51,616
and you can place it at any location that you want

90
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:53,283
on your file system.

91
00:04:01,117 --> 00:04:01,950
Okay, great.

92
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,935
Now Eclipse'll really start running,

93
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:07,075
and we should see the welcome screen real soon now.

94
00:04:07,075 --> 00:04:09,822
Okay, great, so here's our welcome screen.

95
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:11,951
So they have an overview, samples,

96
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,076
tutorials, what's new, so on.

97
00:04:14,076 --> 00:04:14,909
At this point,

98
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:15,742
I always like to make sure

99
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:17,323
that I'm using the correct version

100
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:18,799
or I downloaded the right version,

101
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,459
the Eclipse Java EE IDE.

102
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,053
Again, we need to make sure we have the Java EE version

103
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:28,220
'cause it has built-in support for Java web applications.

104
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:30,237
All right, great.

105
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:32,493
So you can go ahead and close this welcome window here.

106
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:34,975
Just click the X at the top left.

107
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:35,837
And there it is.

108
00:04:35,837 --> 00:04:37,179
So this is the basic Eclipse.

109
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,654
Right now there's no projects,

110
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,592
no servers,

111
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:41,317
it's pretty plain vanilla right now.

112
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:42,150
And don't worry,

113
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,983
as we go through the course,

114
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:43,816
we'll create projects,

115
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,106
we'll create web applications

116
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:47,462
and deploy them to our servers.

117
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:48,295
Great job.
