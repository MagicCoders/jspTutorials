00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:02,857
<v Instructor>Hey, in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:04,438
I'm gonna give you an overview

3
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:08,021
of setting up your development environment.

4
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:11,527
We'll cover the following topics.

5
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:13,549
I'll discuss the required software

6
00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:17,466
and we'll also go through the high-level steps.

7
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:21,438
One prerequisite is that you must have

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,732
the Java Development Kit installed.

9
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:27,149
That's the JDK, not the JRE, but the JDK.

10
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:30,371
In regards to the required software,

11
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:31,983
to build these web applications,

12
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:33,540
you need to have the following.

13
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,083
You need to have a Java Application Server,

14
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,000
and an IDE.

15
00:00:37,055 --> 00:00:38,888
Regarding the Java App Server,

16
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,352
there's a lot of different options

17
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:43,106
like GlassFish, JBoss, WebLogic, and so on,

18
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:44,441
but we're gonna keep it simple

19
00:00:44,441 --> 00:00:47,120
and make use of the Tomcat Server.

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,918
Next, for the IDE, again, a lot of different options.

21
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:53,585
We'll simply focus on using the Eclipse IDE.

22
00:00:57,827 --> 00:01:00,260
What I'll do is I'll actually break these videos up.

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,976
I'll have a separate video installing

24
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:05,183
the Tomcat Java App Server, and then I'll have

25
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:09,100
a separate video on installing the Eclipse IDE.

26
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:13,298
This wraps up the video.

27
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:14,892
We covered the required software.

28
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,910
We also discussed the high-level steps.

29
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,930
Let's go ahead in the following videos.

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,056
We'll actually go through and install our Java App Server,

31
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:23,251
and we'll install the Eclipse IDE.

32
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:26,751
All right, I'll see you in the next video.
