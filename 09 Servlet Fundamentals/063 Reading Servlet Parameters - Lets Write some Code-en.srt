1
00:00:01,036 --> 00:00:03,578
<v ->All right, so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:05,007
and what I wanna do is continue

3
00:00:05,007 --> 00:00:06,533
to use that servletdemo project

4
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:09,716
that we've been working on so far.

5
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:10,897
And what we wanna do is define

6
00:00:10,897 --> 00:00:12,472
some configuration parameters,

7
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:13,740
so that's kinda our first step.

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,758
So, in web content, web inf,

9
00:00:15,758 --> 00:00:18,153
there's a file here called web.xml.

10
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:19,520
let's go ahead and double click this file

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,770
and open it up.

12
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:25,928
All right, so this is our standard web XML file,

13
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:27,726
our configuration file.

14
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:29,634
There's a lot of other information in here

15
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:32,548
regarding other web app details,

16
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:34,040
but what I'll do right now is I'll simply

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,992
focus on adding some context parameters here

18
00:00:36,992 --> 00:00:39,596
or some config information to this file

19
00:00:39,596 --> 00:00:42,042
so I can read the data.

20
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,359
So, the first thing I do is I start out with a context param

21
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:47,330
and then I need to add two sub elements,

22
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:49,126
I need to add a param name.

23
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:52,876
So, here I'll call it max shopping cart size.

24
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:57,486
And then I need to provide a param value.

25
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,576
So, for this example we'll say our

26
00:01:01,576 --> 00:01:03,542
max shopping cart size is 99.

27
00:01:03,542 --> 00:01:06,389
We could always change this at a later time,

28
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:10,306
that's the whole idea of a configuration param.

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,596
All right, so, that's a param that's set up right now.

30
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:16,655
let's go ahead and add one more parameter here.

31
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,738
So, I'll set up another context param

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,787
and I'll give it another name,

33
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:24,370
I'll say param name

34
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:27,911
and I'll call it project team name,

35
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:30,154
and again I'm totally making up these parameter names.

36
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:31,761
You can give whatever parameter name

37
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:34,190
that you'd like along with any value.

38
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,682
So, here I'll say param name

39
00:01:35,682 --> 00:01:38,619
and I'll call ourselves the coding gurus

40
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,869
'cause we're awesome, yeah.

41
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:43,148
I'm havin' some fun here.

42
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:45,365
So, anyway, that's our second parameter

43
00:01:45,365 --> 00:01:46,996
we've set up, project team name,

44
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:48,333
value of coding gurus.

45
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,166
So, this is great.

46
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:52,275
This is our web.xml file and we can read this information

47
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:54,442
using our servlet context.

48
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:03,064
All right, so we can go ahead and save this file

49
00:02:03,064 --> 00:02:04,426
and now we'll need to write a servlet

50
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:06,462
that can actually read the information

51
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:08,219
from this configuration.

52
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,049
So, I'll move into my Java package directory

53
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,939
and I will create a new servlet.

54
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:14,909
So, I'll right click,

55
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:16,742
I'll say new, servlet.

56
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:24,928
So, for this servlet here,

57
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:27,130
I'll call it TestParamServlet

58
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,171
and I'll keep all the other defaults here

59
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:30,628
in this screen.

60
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:31,984
And once I'm happy with this name

61
00:02:31,984 --> 00:02:33,817
I'll go ahead and click on finish.

62
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:35,780
So, again, Eclipse does all the work,

63
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,054
they generate a servlet for us,

64
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:39,183
they help us get started,

65
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:41,901
they set up the at web servlet annotation,

66
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:45,376
and they also set up our class that extends HTP servlet.

67
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,572
So, again, Eclipse is doin' a lot of good stuff

68
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:48,405
for us.

69
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:49,238
Woohoo.

70
00:02:52,742 --> 00:02:54,900
And what I wanna do is clear out some space here,

71
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,976
I need to clear my desk so I can get down

72
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:58,284
and do some work here,

73
00:02:58,284 --> 00:03:00,460
and I'm gonna focus on the do get method.

74
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,654
This is where I'm gonna read the information

75
00:03:02,654 --> 00:03:04,220
from that configuration.

76
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,060
And I'll get rid of that auto-generated code

77
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,836
because I want to write my own code from scratch.

78
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,961
So, again, I always like to put comments her,

79
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:15,121
so step one is us setting the content type,

80
00:03:15,121 --> 00:03:17,441
step two is getting the printwriter,

81
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:19,477
and now my step three is gonna be a little different here,

82
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:22,119
so, step three is where I'm actually gonna read

83
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,952
the param information.

84
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:28,868
So, I'm gonna read the configuration parameters.

85
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:29,701
And then finally, step four,

86
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:30,920
I'll do the standard thing

87
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,087
of generating HTML content on the fly.

88
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,424
So, that's the basic outline here for this do get method.

89
00:03:41,424 --> 00:03:42,839
Getting the content type,

90
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:44,212
getting the printwriter,

91
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:45,494
reading config params,

92
00:03:45,494 --> 00:03:48,244
and then generating HTML content.

93
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:53,782
So, step one, setting content type.

94
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,783
I simply use the response.setcontenttype

95
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,533
and I give text HTML.

96
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:02,391
And then again for my printwriter

97
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:04,516
I'll say PrintWriter out equals

98
00:04:04,516 --> 00:04:06,099
response.getwriter.

99
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:10,589
And I go through that standard process

100
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:12,677
of fixing the imports here,

101
00:04:12,677 --> 00:04:14,668
so the import on printwriter

102
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:17,168
that's in the java.io package.

103
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:21,994
Now, step three,

104
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:23,987
this is kinda like my new part for this video,

105
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:26,680
so I'm gonna read those cont configuration parameters.

106
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,529
Remember, I need to make use of that servlet context,

107
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,573
so here I'll say servletContext

108
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,579
equals get servletcontext.

109
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:36,375
And remember that method getservletcontext

110
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,603
is actually inherited form HTP servlet.

111
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,844
So, that base class that our servlet inherits from,

112
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:44,368
that's where we get that method.

113
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:46,890
And over on the left I'll fix the imports here

114
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,254
for this servlet context.

115
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,386
It's in the javax.servlet package

116
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:51,744
and now I have a handle to it,

117
00:04:51,744 --> 00:04:53,077
so that's great.

118
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,029
So, now I can really do some stuff here.

119
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:57,411
Now I have this context object,

120
00:04:57,411 --> 00:04:58,946
I can actually read some information

121
00:04:58,946 --> 00:05:00,779
from that config file.

122
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:04,716
So, here for reading the max cart size

123
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:07,464
I say context get init parameter

124
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:10,104
and then I give max shopping cart size.

125
00:05:10,104 --> 00:05:11,246
So, that's the param name that's

126
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:13,829
in that XML configuration file.

127
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:17,563
And then my configuration file

128
00:05:17,563 --> 00:05:20,140
actually has a second parameter

129
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,407
and that's the actual project team name.

130
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:26,876
So, again I say context get init parameter,

131
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,991
and I give project team name,

132
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:33,158
again the actual name from the configuration file.

133
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,314
All right, and that's basically it for step three,

134
00:05:36,314 --> 00:05:37,577
reading the config param,

135
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:40,184
so we get the context and then we use that context

136
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:42,108
get init parameter to read the params

137
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,551
for a max shopping cart size

138
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,085
and project team name.

139
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:47,335
So, this looks good so far.

140
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,990
And then step four is just more of a validation for ourself,

141
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,106
we're simply gonna just

142
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,269
generate some HTML content,

143
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:00,248
so I take care of my html housekeeping up front

144
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:01,415
with HTML body

145
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:03,811
and I'll just do a copy paste

146
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:06,247
and I'll drop in the closing tags here

147
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,497
for slash body, slash html.

148
00:06:14,044 --> 00:06:15,853
And now I simply just wanna print out those values

149
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:17,693
that I retrieved from a configuration file.

150
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:20,776
So, I'll print out the max cart size.

151
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,131
Oh and a small typo here,

152
00:06:26,131 --> 00:06:28,268
this should be maxCartSize.

153
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:29,553
Okay, good, fixed that one.

154
00:06:29,553 --> 00:06:30,470
Ooh, close.

155
00:06:32,242 --> 00:06:35,309
And actually let me add a little br here,

156
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:36,142
line break,

157
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:38,809
just to separate the lines here.

158
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,842
And then let me just print out the team name

159
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:48,509
and that's what I read earlier in this code.

160
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:51,512
And that's kind of it.

161
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,047
This looks good.

162
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,226
So, this basically just prints out the values

163
00:06:55,226 --> 00:06:58,976
that we retrieve from the configuration file.

164
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,655
Simply showing the output there

165
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,190
in our HTML.

166
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,051
So, this looks really good,

167
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:05,145
I'm excited about this.

168
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:05,978
Good job.

169
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:10,225
All right, so let's go ahead and test this out.

170
00:07:10,225 --> 00:07:13,123
So, we can test this by running our servlet directly.

171
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,773
So, I can move down to this testparamservlet

172
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:16,930
and I can do a right click,

173
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,451
and I can choose run as,

174
00:07:18,451 --> 00:07:20,368
and then run on server.

175
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,404
And wow, this looks really good.

176
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:29,744
So, here it said max cart of 99

177
00:07:29,744 --> 00:07:33,046
and team project name of The Coding Gurus,

178
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:34,435
because we're awesome.

179
00:07:34,435 --> 00:07:35,899
And that's all the information that we read

180
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:38,580
from that XML file that we set up,

181
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,603
our web.xml,

182
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:41,619
so it read the max shopping cart size

183
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,345
and also the project team name.

184
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:44,782
And our servlet read that information

185
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:47,207
and displayed the html content.

186
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:48,168
So, this is great.

187
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,732
This is exactly what we wanted to do.

188
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:52,574
So, I would say, mission accomplished.

189
00:07:52,574 --> 00:07:53,407
Good job.
