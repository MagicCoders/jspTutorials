<v Chad Darby>Hi. In this video, we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:07,153
how to use Servlet Configuration Parameters.

3
00:00:09,605 --> 00:00:11,852
Now, when you're developing applications,

4
00:00:11,852 --> 00:00:14,160
you never want to hard code special values

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,649
in your application.

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,303
It would be great if you could put that information

7
00:00:17,303 --> 00:00:19,096
in a configuration file

8
00:00:19,096 --> 00:00:21,174
to make your application more flexible.

9
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:23,398
So with servlets and JSPs,

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,917
your web app can actually make use of

11
00:00:25,917 --> 00:00:28,285
configuration parameters as part of

12
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:29,907
the servlet's specification

13
00:00:29,907 --> 00:00:31,323
they have a standard file where you can

14
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:32,879
place this information.

15
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:36,124
It's in the WEB-INF/web.xml file.

16
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:38,031
And again, it's a standard part of the servlet's

17
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:40,579
specification where you can set your data.

18
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:44,437
So here's an example of this file, web.xml.

19
00:00:44,437 --> 00:00:47,505
Here, we have a section here for context params

20
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,305
and this is where you define your properties

21
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:50,584
or your parameters.

22
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,505
So you can specify a parameter name

23
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:53,957
and a parameter value

24
00:00:53,957 --> 00:00:55,862
and it's totally up to you as far as the name

25
00:00:55,862 --> 00:00:57,891
and values that you specify.

26
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,895
So in this example, I'm gonna set up

27
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:01,890
a max shopping cart size,

28
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,521
and I set the value to 99.

29
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:07,729
Then I'll have another parameter here called

30
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,164
the param name is project-team-name,

31
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:12,558
and I give the value of The Coding Gurus.

32
00:01:12,558 --> 00:01:14,605
Again, I'm just making this up.

33
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:17,307
You can have as many parameters as you'd like.

34
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:20,349
There's no limit, and you can place all this information

35
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:23,932
in this web.xml file, which is really cool.

36
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:28,455
All right, so let's look at how to actually read

37
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,399
these configuration parameters.

38
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,498
So in this servlet's source code,

39
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:34,778
either a doGet or doPost method,

40
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:37,169
we can read this information.

41
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:38,625
So remember in the bottom right,

42
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,012
there's this web.xml file

43
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:43,985
that has all this configuration information as xml.

44
00:01:43,985 --> 00:01:48,086
We can read this information in our servlet source code.

45
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:49,204
So the first thing we need to do

46
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:51,483
is we need to get the servlet context.

47
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:55,518
So here we say ServletContext = getServletContext.

48
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:57,150
The method getServletContext

49
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,593
is a method we inherit from the http server.

50
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:03,558
So that's a method that we inherit that we get for free.

51
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:06,062
So to give us a ServletContext object,

52
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:10,231
this ServletContext object is basically just a helper class

53
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,180
that allows us to do web-related stuff.

54
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,361
One of those features is that it allows us

55
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:18,962
to read information from that web.xml file.

56
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:22,926
So that web.xml file is actually an xml file.

57
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:26,738
However, this ServletContext will actually read that file,

58
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:30,082
parse it, and then have this information in memory

59
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:32,082
that we can make use of.

60
00:02:34,447 --> 00:02:37,491
So I can read the parameter information

61
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,324
by saying context.getInitParameter

62
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,552
and I give the parameter name.

63
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,850
So here I'm gonna read parameter name

64
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,917
max-shopping-cart-size.

65
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,430
It'll return this value as a string.

66
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,359
I can do a similar thing here for project-team-name.

67
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:59,109
So I can say context.getInitParameter("project-team-name")

68
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,785
and it'll return the value.

69
00:03:01,785 --> 00:03:04,694
All right, now two things here on this method.

70
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:07,832
First off is that the context.getInitParameter method,

71
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:11,032
it'll always return the data as a String.

72
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,719
So if you want to use it as a different data type

73
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:14,673
like an image or a Boolean,

74
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:17,427
you'd have to convert it yourself.

75
00:03:17,427 --> 00:03:20,320
Also, this context.getInitParameter method,

76
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,531
if the parameter does not exist,

77
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:25,468
this method will simply return a value of null.

78
00:03:25,468 --> 00:03:26,728
Okay, so no exceptions thrown in there

79
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,057
will simply return a null value.

80
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:31,152
So you'll have to do some additional checks on that

81
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:33,152
for that property value.

82
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:36,501
All right, but hey, so we've read

83
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,652
the property values here so we have max-cart,

84
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,946
we have team-name, then we can display this information

85
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:43,431
in our servlet, so here I say

86
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,720
out.println("Max cart: give the value

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,915
and then out.println("Team name:

88
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:50,790
and then give the actual team name.

89
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,796
And that's basically it so that's the java code

90
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:57,494
there for reading information from that configuration file.

91
00:03:57,494 --> 00:04:01,077
Reading information from that web.xml file.

92
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,554
All right, so good job, so what we're gonna do

93
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:07,438
in the next video is we're gonna move and save clips,

94
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:09,430
we're gonna write some code from scratch,

95
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,324
and we're gonna see how we can read

96
00:04:11,324 --> 00:04:14,244
configuration parameters for our application.

97
00:04:14,244 --> 00:04:17,327
Okay, I'll see ya in the next video.
