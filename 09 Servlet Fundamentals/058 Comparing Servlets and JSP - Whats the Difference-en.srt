1
00:00:01,807 --> 00:00:03,335
<v Instructor>Hey, so in this video we're gonna</v>

2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:05,418
compare servlets and JSP.

3
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:09,073
Now we've seen how we can build

4
00:00:09,073 --> 00:00:11,897
applications using JSP so far in the course.

5
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:13,745
So we built JSPs to read a request

6
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:15,265
and send back a response.

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,314
And also we've just learned about

8
00:00:16,314 --> 00:00:19,205
how we can use servlets to read a request

9
00:00:19,205 --> 00:00:21,254
and also send back a response.

10
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:23,693
So you may wonder, well, which one

11
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:24,526
should I use?

12
00:00:24,526 --> 00:00:25,424
(laughs)

13
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:26,877
It looks like you can do the same thing

14
00:00:26,877 --> 00:00:28,535
with servlets and JSPs and kinda

15
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:31,080
what's the best practice, what should I do?

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,250
So basically, just a quick recap here.

17
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:38,346
JSPs is really just an HTML file with a .jsp extension.

18
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:41,593
It has some static HTML and also some JSP

19
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:44,393
to generate HTML on the fly as needed.

20
00:00:44,393 --> 00:00:47,083
And also JSP's as you know, has a collection

21
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:51,294
of built-in JSP objects that you can make use of directly.

22
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:54,653
Now when we look at servlets, it's really a Java class file

23
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:57,231
so it's a like a hello world servlet.java.

24
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:59,553
It's a class that extends, we write methods,

25
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:02,804
we have to write all of the code to generate the HTML.

26
00:01:02,804 --> 00:01:04,967
And also, there's some additional steps to access some

27
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,218
of the web objects like,

28
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:08,398
response set content type, response getwriter,

29
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:12,638
and so on, and we have to do a lot of work ourself.

30
00:01:12,638 --> 00:01:14,875
So, in general it's a little easier to write code

31
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:17,442
using JSP's, but there's still a purpose

32
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:20,192
for servlets in the architecture.

33
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:25,186
So kinda speaking on that purpose,

34
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:27,618
you may wonder, which one should I use?

35
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:30,739
Well, you can use either one for building Java

36
00:01:30,739 --> 00:01:33,102 line:15% 
web apps, so you can actually build your entire

37
00:01:33,102 --> 00:01:35,240 line:15% 
site only using servlets.

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,326 line:15% 
And I actually did this back in 1998,

39
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:40,011 line:15% 
cause servlets was the first Java server technology

40
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:42,601 line:15% 
that was out, and JSP's did not exist.

41
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,907 line:15% 
So I actually built an entire site using servlets

42
00:01:44,907 --> 00:01:46,186 line:15% 
for a major client,

43
00:01:46,186 --> 00:01:49,031 line:15% 
or you can build the entire site using JSP's.

44
00:01:49,031 --> 00:01:51,816 line:15% 
But now that we have the technology and it's

45
00:01:51,816 --> 00:01:54,167
matured a bit, you can actually

46
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,985
use them to gather, and that's a best practice.

47
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:57,743
So here, we can integrate them both together

48
00:01:57,743 --> 00:02:00,799
where we have the servlet that'll do the business

49
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,494
logic and then the JSP page will handle the

50
00:02:03,494 --> 00:02:05,001
presentation view.

51
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,731
And this is actually a very popular design

52
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:10,662
pattern called the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern,

53
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:11,990
or MVC.

54
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,978
This design pattern is used by a lot of the popular

55
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:17,895
Java frame works like, Spring MVC, JSF, Struts,

56
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,015
and so on.

57
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:24,115
They're all based on this idea of a Model-View-Controller

58
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:24,948
Design Pattern, and they make use of servlets and

59
00:02:24,948 --> 00:02:27,649
JSP'a at the lower level.

60
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,650
So, what I'll do is I'll have another section of

61
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,506
videos coming up shortly where we'll actually

62
00:02:33,506 --> 00:02:36,021
go through the Model-View-Controller Design Pattern

63
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:39,776
in detail, so I'll show you how to set the servlet up,

64
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,733
I'll show you how to have the servlet talk to the JSP,

65
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,212
and how the JSP will send data back.

66
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:46,444
So, we'll get into all the gory details on how to do

67
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:49,623
MVC from scratch with servlets in JSP's.

68
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:52,460
So anyway, I just wanted to kind of address that issue

69
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,135
cause I know a lot of folks always ask

70
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:57,149
the difference between servlets and JSP's and

71
00:02:57,149 --> 00:02:59,142
I wanted to kind of just address that.

72
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:01,442
But what I wanna do now is just kind of,

73
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,731
move forward a bit and we'll focus on servlets

74
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,220
just by itself for the next couple of videos

75
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,639
and then we'll come back and we'll pull it all together

76
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,233
with servlets and JSP's together.

77
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,250
So, don't worry, a lot of good things here,

78
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,116
and a lot of good ground to cover.

79
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:18,699
I'll see you in the next video.
