<v Instructor>Hey, in this video we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:06,508
how to read HTML form data with servlets.

3
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:11,543
So we'll start off with a student-form.html;

4
00:00:11,543 --> 00:00:13,575
that's gonna be our HTML form.

5
00:00:13,575 --> 00:00:16,835
We're gonna gather the students first name and last name.

6
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:19,547
They'll hit the submit button, the request will go across

7
00:00:19,547 --> 00:00:22,078
to our servlet, StudentServlet.java,

8
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:24,096
our servlet will process the request,

9
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:26,353
and then send back a response.

10
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:27,848
So that's the basic idea here

11
00:00:27,848 --> 00:00:30,765
of having a servlet read form data.

12
00:00:33,505 --> 00:00:35,609
All right, so let's kind of walk through this step-by-step.

13
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:38,108
So the first step is building the HTML form,

14
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:39,955
and we've seen most of this before.

15
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:42,517
So we start off with our form, and now the action

16
00:00:42,517 --> 00:00:44,303
equals the student servlet; so that's the name

17
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:46,915
of the servlet that we're calling, and then we set up

18
00:00:46,915 --> 00:00:49,872
method equals get because we wanna make use

19
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:52,868
of a get request to that servlet.

20
00:00:52,868 --> 00:00:56,069
Then, from there, we simply set up the HTML form fields.

21
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:57,823
So we set up first name field,

22
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:01,047
last name field, and also a submit button.

23
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,290
So, again, we've seen a lot of this stuff before,

24
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,045
just a basic form that we're setting up for our example.

25
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:10,187
Now the one thing that's different here or unique

26
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:12,811
that I wanna point out here is that since this form

27
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:16,273
is gonna send the data using method equals get,

28
00:01:16,273 --> 00:01:20,621
this actually calls the do get method in your servlet.

29
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:22,348
All right, so method equals get

30
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:25,541
will call the do get method in your servlet.

31
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:28,130
So you have to make sure that you override the appropriate

32
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,297
handler method or make sure you override the do get method.

33
00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:36,309
Now the next step here is reading the form data

34
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:38,646
in the servlet, so at at the top I showed you

35
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:41,470
the first name and last name; and then at the bottom,

36
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,124
this is the actual servlet code.

37
00:01:43,124 --> 00:01:46,233
So, again, we override the appropriate method here,

38
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:49,454
do get, they pass in a request, the request object

39
00:01:49,454 --> 00:01:53,608
has your form data, or it contains the form data.

40
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:56,403
So here I simply use an out.print line,

41
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:57,906
the student is confirmed;

42
00:01:57,906 --> 00:02:00,313
and here I say request.getParameter.

43
00:02:00,313 --> 00:02:02,466
That allows me to read form data.

44
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:04,935
So request.getParameter on first name

45
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:07,749
and then request.getParameter for last name.

46
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:09,479
So those parameter names map

47
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,479
to the actual HTML form field names.

48
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:18,218
And that's basically it here for our servlet example.

49
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:20,046
What we're gonna do in the next video is we're gonna move

50
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:22,808
into eclipse, we're gonna get some hands on practice,

51
00:02:22,808 --> 00:02:25,794
and we'll actually build this example from scratch.

52
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:28,627
So I'll see you in the next video.
