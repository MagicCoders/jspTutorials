00:00:01,312 --> 00:00:02,700
<v Narrator>Hey, so let's go ahead and do</v>

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,700
a project review of our application.

3
00:00:07,884 --> 00:00:10,954
So our main focus was to create a full working

4
00:00:10,954 --> 00:00:15,491
JSP and Servlet application that connects to a database.

5
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:19,658
And we actually covered that in the previous videos.

6
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:24,501
So we went through and set up our database environment

7
00:00:24,501 --> 00:00:25,645
and then we went through and wrote

8
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:27,607
the code for listing students.

9
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:29,657
Next we learned how to add a new student,

10
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:32,744
how to update a student, and how to delete a student.

11
00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:35,797
So I'd like to say mission accomplished (chuckles).

12
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:39,038
We accomplished all the major features that you need

13
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,195
when you build a database application.

14
00:00:41,195 --> 00:00:42,837
We covered all of the good stuff.

15
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:46,222
So you also have the source code that you can download.

16
00:00:46,222 --> 00:00:48,339
There's also the database scripts, along with

17
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,780
setup instructions, and also, this is

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,965
a really good start for your own application.

19
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:56,384
So maybe it's a school project, or maybe

20
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:59,196
you're getting up to speed for a project at the office.

21
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:02,166
A good start to help you out, so anyway,

22
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,347
congratulations for making it this far,

23
00:01:04,347 --> 00:01:07,597
and again, mission accomplished, oorah.
