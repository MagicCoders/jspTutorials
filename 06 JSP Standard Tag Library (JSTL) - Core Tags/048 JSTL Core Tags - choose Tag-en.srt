00:00:01,088 --> 00:00:02,007
<v Narrator>Hey.</v>

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:03,293
In this video, we're going to learn

3
00:00:03,293 --> 00:00:05,460
how to use the choose tag.

4
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,838
So, JSTL has a choose statement.

5
00:00:10,838 --> 00:00:13,865
This tag is very similar to a switch statement,

6
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:16,558
so we can basically test some conditions,

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,881
and then we'll have an otherwise, or default, handler.

8
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:24,048
I'll show you some code examples on how to do this.

9
00:00:27,204 --> 00:00:30,464
Here's our basic example that we've been working on so far.

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,466
I'll make use of the choose statement,

11
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,544
and then we can put in different cases we want to test for.

12
00:00:35,544 --> 00:00:36,765
The first one here,

13
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:39,894
when test="${tempStudent.goldCustomer}"

14
00:00:39,894 --> 00:00:43,043
so if they're a gold customer, will display special student.

15
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,286
Else, we have an otherwise here,

16
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:47,521
and that'll handle all the other cases.

17
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:51,688
You can add as many when conditionals as you'd like.

18
00:00:54,307 --> 00:00:55,801
All right, so let's move into Eclipse,

19
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:59,384 line:15% 
and let's try this out with a code example.

20
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,943 line:15% 
What I like to do is move down to my WebContent directory,

21
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:06,665 line:15% 
and I'm going to basically copy our previous files,

22
00:01:06,665 --> 00:01:08,262
our if-student-test.

23
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:09,534
We're going to copy this one,

24
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:11,144
and make some enhancements to it.

25
00:01:11,144 --> 00:01:13,224
So I'll simply do a right-click,

26
00:01:13,224 --> 00:01:14,974
and I'll choose Copy.

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,483
And then likewise, I'll simply just

28
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:22,316
do a right-click and choose Paste.

29
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,619
Then on here I'll give it a new name.

30
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,786
The new name, I'll call it choose-student-test.jsp

31
00:01:36,053 --> 00:01:37,588
All right, and then once your happy with the filename,

32
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:40,588
just go ahead and hit the OK button.

33
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:45,280
All right, so here's our file.

34
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,097
Let me just go ahead and open it up here,

35
00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:49,014
choose-student-test.jsp

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,477
Expand my window here,

37
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:54,260
and again, everything's like we had in a previous video.

38
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,885
I simply want to make use of the choose statement here,

39
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,202
and kind of work around that little hack we had

40
00:02:00,202 --> 00:02:02,716
for not having an else statement previously.

41
00:02:02,716 --> 00:02:04,716
So here I'll say
c:choose

42
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,944
I'll add the end tag for it,

43
00:02:07,944 --> 00:02:10,944
and I'll move it down to the bottom.

44
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:17,567
Now this first if test, I'll change this to a when,

45
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:21,131
'cause this is my new test case I'm setting up.

46
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:24,077
And I'll also set up the matching when here.

47
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay, great, so

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,148
when test="${tempStudent.goldCustomer}"

49
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,074
then we'll display Special Discount.

50
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:32,573
And again, we can copy this when clause,

51
00:02:32,573 --> 00:02:35,234
X number of times for different cases.

52
00:02:35,234 --> 00:02:37,612
But here, this is kind of our else statement,

53
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:40,273
that we kind of did a little hack workaround with.

54
00:02:40,273 --> 00:02:42,134
This is how we can clean it up here.

55
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:43,910
I can say c:otherwise

56
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,786
So basically, if none of the when clauses match,

57
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:49,631
then otherwise it'll execute this portion.

58
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:53,298
So otherwise, we'll just simply give a dash.

59
00:02:54,525 --> 00:02:56,071
Let me just tab this in a bit

60
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,513
so we can see all the flow formatting together.

61
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,053
All right, now one thing I want to do is the otherwise.

62
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:04,816
Instead of the dash, I want to give something different,

63
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:06,314
something funny. (laughs)

64
00:03:06,314 --> 00:03:07,565
Let's have fun with this.

65
00:03:07,565 --> 00:03:10,052
So I'll say, "no soup for you!"

66
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:11,628
That's a classic quote from

67
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:14,867
an American TV show, Seinfeld.

68
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,371
So anyway, no soup for you

69
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:19,692
if you're not a Special Gold customer. (laughs)

70
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:21,897
All right, so that's basically our layout here.

71
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,694
We're testing for Gold Customer,

72
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:26,846
and if you don't match, then no soup for you.

73
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:28,349
So let's run this one.

74
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:30,097
I'm having too much fun here.

75
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:32,535
Right-click on choose-student-test.jsp,

76
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,368
Run As, Run on Server.

77
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,500
Okay, great, woo-hoo!

78
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,618
Here's our output.

79
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,357
So if they're not a Gold Customer,

80
00:03:40,357 --> 00:03:42,206
we say, "no soup for you!"

81
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:43,960
And if they are a Gold Customer,

82
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,034
then we show Special Discount.

83
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:50,201
We did all of this stuff using that new choose tag in JSTL.

84
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,365
Hey, this looks really, really good.

85
00:03:54,365 --> 00:03:55,198
Great job.
