00:00:01,375 --> 00:00:02,904
<v Narrator>Hey, in this video we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:02,904 --> 00:00:04,571
how to use JSP tags.

3
00:00:06,986 --> 00:00:08,791
I'll cover the following topics.

4
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:11,242
We'll first learn, what are JSP tags,

5
00:00:11,242 --> 00:00:13,369
then we'll look at a sample use case,

6
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:16,676
and then we'll also discuss the benefits of JSP tags.

7
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:18,228
Alright, so a lot of good stuff here.

8
00:00:18,228 --> 00:00:20,811
Let's go ahead and get started.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,564
There's actually two categories of JSP tags.

10
00:00:25,564 --> 00:00:27,824
One is that you have JSP custom tags.

11
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:30,855
That's where you can write your own, custom code

12
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:33,816
and implement that code and use it as a tag.

13
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:36,349
And I'll show you how to do that later in the course.

14
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:37,938
There's also another category called

15
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,522
JSP standard tag libraries.

16
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:43,355
So the folks at Oracle, they've created a common set

17
00:00:43,355 --> 00:00:47,401
of tags that you can make use of in your JSP environment.

18
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:51,568
And I'll show you how to do that also in this course.

19
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:55,395
Alright, so let's look at a problem here.

20
00:00:55,395 --> 00:00:59,087
We get the email from the boss, and he says,

21
00:00:59,087 --> 00:01:02,228
we want to include a weather report in our JSP pages.

22
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,409
And we need it by the end of today (laughs).

23
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,242
Right, that always happens.

24
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,712
You need it now.

25
00:01:07,712 --> 00:01:10,195
What we're gonna do here is look at some solutions

26
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,175
and how we can implement this for the boss,

27
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:15,530
as far as making use of weather reports

28
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:16,947
in our JSP pages.

29
00:01:19,992 --> 00:01:24,159
One option, is that we can make use of scriptlets.

30
00:01:25,513 --> 00:01:28,226
With a scriptlet, you simply have an angle bracket percent,

31
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:30,340
and then you simply start writing Java code.

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,781
So here we could write codes that connect

33
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:34,301
to the remote service, submit our request,

34
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:36,463
get the results, parse the data,

35
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:40,168
maybe xml or json, and finally display the output

36
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:41,904
in a JSP page.

37
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:44,307
That's possible, and we can do it.

38
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:47,101
However, I wouldn't recommend it.

39
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:49,184
And it's actually bad practice.

40
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:53,059
Because one, we'll have a lot of Java code in our JSP pages.

41
00:01:53,059 --> 00:01:55,486
And remember earlier, I always said minimize

42
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:58,383
the amount of scriptlet code in your JSP page,

43
00:01:58,383 --> 00:02:01,614
and we're mixing business code and presentation code.

44
00:02:01,614 --> 00:02:03,697
It's all getting woven together, so it's gonna look

45
00:02:03,697 --> 00:02:05,536
really ugly at the end.

46
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:08,076
And then finally, it's not reusable

47
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:10,778
and not really maintainable either.

48
00:02:10,778 --> 00:02:12,609
Ideally, what you'd want to do is make use

49
00:02:12,609 --> 00:02:14,909
of JSP custom tags.

50
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,900
Basically, you're gonna move your heavy, business logic

51
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,909
into supporting classes, and then you simply insert

52
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:25,961
a custom tag to make use of that supporting class.

53
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:29,006
As an example, on our JSP page we can drop in

54
00:02:29,006 --> 00:02:31,411
this custom tag called weather report.

55
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,376
Let's say city equals, insert your favorite city.

56
00:02:34,376 --> 00:02:37,403
And then the real heavy lifting is implement it

57
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:39,346
by a supporting JAVA class.

58
00:02:39,346 --> 00:02:42,104
So note here how a JSP page is really simple.

59
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:45,003
We simply have this one tag here, and all the real heavy

60
00:02:45,003 --> 00:02:47,590
coding is in a backend JAVA class.

61
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,385
And using all of that information together,

62
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:52,594
this will allow us to get a weather report

63
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:55,592
and make use of it on our JSP page.

64
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,572
So that's the idea.

65
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:58,241
You want to make use of custom tags

66
00:02:58,241 --> 00:03:02,158
to implement some of your custom functionality.

67
00:03:04,463 --> 00:03:06,890
Now, what are the benefits of using custom tags?

68
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,580
Well, first off, it minimizes the amount of scriptlet code

69
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,199
in your JSP.

70
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,868
Also avoids dumping thousands of lines of code in your JSP.

71
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,340
And then the page is simple.

72
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,678
The main focus of the page is only the presentation.

73
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:23,012
And the tag itself is reusable.

74
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:26,002
You can easily reuse that tag in other JSP pages

75
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:29,169
in your project, or on other projects.

76
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,212
Alright, so that covers custom tags.

77
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,705
There's also what they call the standard tag library,

78
00:03:36,705 --> 00:03:38,406
or the JSTL.

79
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:41,353
Oracle created a common set of tags that you can use

80
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:42,686
on any project.

81
00:03:42,686 --> 00:03:46,139
There's some core tags for handling variables

82
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,358
and looping and conditionals.

83
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:51,806
There's also message tags for handling internationalization

84
00:03:51,806 --> 00:03:53,465
and formatting.

85
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:57,144
There's function tags for doing string manipulation,

86
00:03:57,144 --> 00:04:00,455
getting the sizes of a collection.

87
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:03,939
There's also a group of tags for XML for parsing

88
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,317
and setting XML data.

89
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:09,460
And finally there's a set of tags called SQL,

90
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,760
for accessing a database.

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,761
In the following videos, I'll cover the first four tags,

92
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:17,773
core, messaging, functions and XML.

93
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:20,983
However, I won't cover the SQL tags.

94
00:04:20,983 --> 00:04:25,150
Because the SQL tags in general are considered bad practice.

95
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,654
So in the industry, they say that those SQL tags

96
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:32,677
are good for prototyping, but not for real-world

97
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,677
production applications.

98
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,800
Anyway, here's some resources for you.

99
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,996
So if you want to look at the custom tags tutorial,

100
00:04:40,996 --> 00:04:42,789
I have a link here on the page.

101
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:45,629
The other JSTL tutorial, another link.

102
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:48,149
Those first two links, they basically just redirect

103
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:52,092
to the documentation from the Oracle site.

104
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,380
And then also there's the official JSTL website

105
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,833
that's available for you.

106
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,500
So I gave you a quick overview of JSP tags.

107
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,350
In the following videos, I'll drill down into each one

108
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,570
of those topics, and I'll show you some coding examples

109
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,329
on how those things work out.

110
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:09,662
Alrighty, I'll see you then.
