00:00:01,298 --> 00:00:02,131
<v Narrator>Hey!</v>

2
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:04,183
In this video, I'm gonna show you how to install the

3
00:00:04,183 --> 00:00:06,266
JSP Standard Tag Library.

4
00:00:09,756 --> 00:00:12,211
All right, so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse.

5
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,606
What we're gonna do here is we're actually

6
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:16,144
gonna create a new project.

7
00:00:16,144 --> 00:00:18,328
So, I'll go to the file menu and I'll say

8
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:21,745
new, and I'll choose Dynamic Web Project.

9
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:29,566
And once the window's open here, for the project name,

10
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:32,149
we'll give the name of tagdemo.

11
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:38,105
And then I'll keep all the other defaults on this screen

12
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,688
and I'll hit the finish button.

13
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:46,698
All right, great.

14
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:48,440
So now I have this new project, tagdemo,

15
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,330
and it's empty right now.

16
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,437
Not much here, but I'm actually gonna add

17
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:53,020
some JST libraries.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,357
So in the WebContent WEB-INF lib directory, it's empty,

19
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,190
I need to add some JAR files here.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,911
Alrighty, so let's go ahead and open up

21
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:06,948
a web browser, and let's go visit this URL here:

22
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:10,115
luv2code.com/download-jstl.

23
00:01:11,873 --> 00:01:14,850
This will allow you to download the JSTL JAR files

24
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,267
to your computer.

25
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,864
Your browser may prompt you, but eventually

26
00:01:19,864 --> 00:01:22,486
it will download a zip file to your computer.

27
00:01:22,486 --> 00:01:25,504
So I can find this file in my downloads directory.

28
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,462
On my computer, it will automatically

29
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,167
unzip that file.

30
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:32,504
So I'll have a directory here called jstl-libs.

31
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:36,026
Inside of this directory are two JAR files that I need

32
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,550
for JSTL.

33
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,556
One's the implementation, and the other is the API.

34
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:42,376
And you need both of these jar files.

35
00:01:42,376 --> 00:01:44,327
So go ahead and select both of those files

36
00:01:44,327 --> 00:01:45,494
and copy them.

37
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:55,739
And then, move over to your Eclipse project,

38
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,850
and we're gonna move into that WEB-INF lib directory

39
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,102
and we're actually gonna paste both of those files

40
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,773
into WEB-INF lib.

41
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:04,650
It's very important that you paste the files

42
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,528
into the WEB-INF lib directory.

43
00:02:06,528 --> 00:02:09,107
This is a special directory that's a class path

44
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:11,190
for your web application.

45
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:16,297
Alrighty, great.

46
00:02:16,297 --> 00:02:17,976
So once you've pasted those files here,

47
00:02:17,976 --> 00:02:19,886
you should have two of them for JSTL.

48
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:21,835
Again, the first one is the implementation,

49
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:23,694
the second one is the actual API.

50
00:02:23,694 --> 00:02:27,777
And you need both of those files in your project.

51
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,010
So, the first thing I need to do is

52
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,712
create a new file to test it out.

53
00:02:34,712 --> 00:02:37,369
So under web content I'll do a right click,

54
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:38,869
I'll so new, file.

55
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,670
And then for the name of the file,

56
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,689
I'll just call it test.jsp.

57
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,419
It's a real simple test here.

58
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:48,846
Once you're happy with the name,

59
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:51,929
go ahead and click the finish button.

60
00:02:53,932 --> 00:02:54,765
Okay, great.

61
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:57,096
So here's my simple file here at test.jsp.

62
00:02:57,096 --> 00:03:01,263
Now let's go ahead and do our normal html housekeeping.

63
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:09,838
And, what I need to do here since I'm using a JSP tag;

64
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:12,781
I need to set up a reference to that tag library.

65
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:14,993
And I make use of it by using angle bracket percent

66
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:19,352
with an @ symbol, and this is new, I say, taglib uri,

67
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:23,422
I give the actual uri that's defined for this tag library...

68
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:25,970
So it's simply just a unique name or a unique identifier

69
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,720
for this tag library.

70
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:32,796
And you have to enter it exactly as I have here.

71
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,020
And then the prefix equals c.

72
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,131
So the prefix c is simply short for core.

73
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:42,752
So we're gonna make use of the core tag library here.

74
00:03:42,752 --> 00:03:44,076
Okay, so this looks good so far.

75
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:47,409
So we have our tag lib reference set up.

76
00:03:50,101 --> 00:03:50,934
All right.

77
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:53,751
So now, with that in place I can go ahead and try it out.

78
00:03:53,751 --> 00:03:57,918
So I'll make use of one of the tags; c;set a variable

79
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,827
and I'm just gonna set this variable called stuff

80
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:03,621
and I'll give it a value of...

81
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,588
And I'll make use of the current time stamp.

82
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:08,927
So I'll just say new java util.date.

83
00:04:08,927 --> 00:04:10,883
So basically I'm just creating a date object

84
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:12,757
and I'm assigning it to a variable.

85
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:15,921
And I'm gonna use that later on in my page.

86
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,013
All right, so there's a variable I have

87
00:04:17,013 --> 00:04:20,782
it's called stuff, that was set using one of the core tags.

88
00:04:20,782 --> 00:04:23,688
And now here I'll just say time on the server is...

89
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:26,494
And then I'll just display the value of stuff.

90
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:29,465
So I can make use of my JSP expression language,

91
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:31,585
that's the dollar sign curly brace,

92
00:04:31,585 --> 00:04:33,431
and just give a reference to stuff.

93
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:36,446
And that's the same stuff that's defined on line seven.

94
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:38,803
So again, just a real quick example here

95
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:40,498
of making use of one of the core tags.

96
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:42,809
I'll go into more details in the following videos.

97
00:04:42,809 --> 00:04:45,530
Just, wanted to just do a quick example here.

98
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,180
All right, so let's save the file.

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,247
Let's go ahead and run it.

100
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,017
And it'll prompt me on which server to use,

101
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:55,649
I always use it, hit okay for that, click finish,

102
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:57,071
and now it's up and running.

103
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:58,610
So in our internal browser here,

104
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,514
time on the server is...

105
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:01,896
And we crop in the time.

106
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:02,981
So this is really good.

107
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:07,161
So we actually make use of the JSTL core tag library

108
00:05:07,161 --> 00:05:10,103
to set a variable, and then we simply displayed it.

109
00:05:10,103 --> 00:05:12,676
Now, again, nothing really fancy here.

110
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:14,922
We'll get on to all the fun stuff later.

111
00:05:14,922 --> 00:05:18,078
Just wanted to get everything set up.

112
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:19,839
Okay, great, so we have JSTL installed on our

113
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,202
local system and we'll make use of it in our

114
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:23,703
following videos.

115
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:24,536
Good job.
