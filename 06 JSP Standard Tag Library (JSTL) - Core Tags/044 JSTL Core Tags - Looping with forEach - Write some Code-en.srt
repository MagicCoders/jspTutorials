1
00:00:01,223 --> 00:00:02,056
<v Instructor>All right, so let's go ahead</v>

2
00:00:02,056 --> 00:00:06,306
and move into Eclipse, and let's write some code.

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,996 line:15% 
So, in this tagdemo project,

4
00:00:07,996 --> 00:00:10,734 line:15% 
I wanna move into my WebContent directory,

5
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:13,181 line:15% 
and I wanna add a new file.

6
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:16,681
So I'll just do right click, say new file.

7
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:23,257
So, the name of this new file, here, I'll call it

8
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,257
foreach-simple-test.jsp.

9
00:00:31,293 --> 00:00:32,740
And once you're happy with that name,

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,740
you can go ahead and click on the finish button.

11
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:41,589
All right, so I'll expand the window here for a second.

12
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:44,153
I'm gonna go ahead and add in the taglib reference here.

13
00:00:44,153 --> 00:00:45,349
So, I'm just gonna copy paste

14
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:46,954
from a little cheat sheet that I have because

15
00:00:46,954 --> 00:00:50,149
I wanna make sure that I get this correct every time.

16
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:52,447
So, the angle bracket percent with the @,

17
00:00:52,447 --> 00:00:54,677
taglib, and the uri, and basically follow

18
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:58,772
everything that I have here on this screen.

19
00:00:58,772 --> 00:01:01,050
All right, so let's go ahead and set up a Scriplet.

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,062
I'm gonna set up a Scriptlet where I can

21
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:06,263
basically set up some sample data.

22
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:08,182
And again, like I said in a previous lecture,

23
00:01:08,182 --> 00:01:10,415
this is normally set provided by your MVC system.

24
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:13,228
I'm just using this as a simple bootstrap here

25
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:14,311
for our demo.

26
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:18,884
So I'll define an array of cities,

27
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:21,884
Mumbai, Singapore, and Philadelphia.

28
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:25,703
And, as I mentioned earlier,

29
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:28,408
we need to set this as a page context attribute,

30
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:31,421
so here I'll say pageContext.setAttribute.

31
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:33,182
I'll simply give a name value here.

32
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:35,849
The name will be myCities, and the value will be

33
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:38,367
the reference to that city's array.

34
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:42,534
And that's basically it for setting up our sample data.

35
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:45,237
So here I'll just move down

36
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,800
and do some basic HTML body tags,

37
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,547
and now I'll make use of that core tag.

38
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,464
So, I'll say c:forEach.

39
00:01:53,444 --> 00:01:56,493
And they'll kinda set up the basic tag here for me,

40
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:59,070
but I still need to fill in some of the blanks here.

41
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,433
So, on the forEach, I'll go through

42
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:01,900
and I'll set up the temporary variable.

43
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,506
I'll say var="tempCity," and then items=,

44
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,289
and I reference that attribute name,

45
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,289
so I'll use ${myCities}.

46
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,524
And again, remember, it matches with the name

47
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:16,036
for the actual attribute that we set up

48
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,786
on line number seven.

49
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:24,327
All right, great, so now I can simply move in here

50
00:02:24,327 --> 00:02:26,716
and make use of the temporary variable.

51
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:30,410
So, I simply make use of the dollar sign, curly brace,

52
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,993
and I say tempCity.

53
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,485
And then I simply just give a br for a line break.

54
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,987
And that's basically it for the body of this forEach tag.

55
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:49,637
All right, so we can go ahead and save this file,

56
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,936
then we can actually run it,

57
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:52,908
so I'll simply just do a right click on this

58
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:55,410
foreach-simple-test.jsp,

59
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,743
I'll say Run As, and then Run on Server.

60
00:03:00,234 --> 00:03:03,036
And our JSP will execute, and great, here's our results.

61
00:03:03,036 --> 00:03:04,446
So, we have our three cities listed,

62
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:06,897
Mumbai, Singapore, and Philadelphia.

63
00:03:06,897 --> 00:03:08,072
And so, the nice thing about this

64
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,280
is that the output here was actually generated

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,544
by making use of that forEach tag

66
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:14,576
that's part of the JSP core.

67
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,243
So, good job so far.
