<v Narrator>Hey!</v>

2
00:00:02,331 --> 00:00:06,498
In this video we're gonna learn about the JSTL Core Tag if.

3
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:11,066
So the if tag is used for a conditional test.

4
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:14,350
So basically the tag will evaluate an expression and

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,672
it'll display the body content only if the expression

6
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:19,172
evaluates to true.

7
00:00:20,798 --> 00:00:23,109
And I have a nice little example of how we can use this

8
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:25,109
in our existing project.

9
00:00:28,092 --> 00:00:30,926
So what we like to do is display Special Discount if

10
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:33,509
the student is a gold customer.

11
00:00:34,537 --> 00:00:38,345
So here's a little code snippet of using this if tag.

12
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:41,451
So basically we say if and then we give test equals

13
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:44,999
and then we specify what we're testing.

14
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:46,621
So here I have a JSP expression.

15
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,795
Temp student dot gold customer.

16
00:00:49,795 --> 00:00:53,928
Now again remember JSP will call the method for you

17
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,209
automatically in the background.

18
00:00:55,209 --> 00:00:59,706
JSP will call temp student dot is gold customer.

19
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:02,184
This method, as you recall from the previous videos,

20
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:04,405
will return a value of true or false.

21
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:05,311
A boolean.

22
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:08,694
So if this value is true then it will display

23
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,494
special discount.

24
00:01:10,494 --> 00:01:14,761
If it evaluates to false it won't display anything.

25
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,536
Alright, so a lot of good stuff here.

26
00:01:16,536 --> 00:01:20,703
Let's move into Eclipse and let's try this code out.

27
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:23,787
Alright, so I'm in Eclipse.

28
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:26,454
I'm using this project tag demo.

29
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:31,016
And what I wanna do is move down to my WebContent folder

30
00:01:31,016 --> 00:01:33,116
and I'm basically gonna make some enhancements to

31
00:01:33,116 --> 00:01:34,743
our previous project.

32
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:38,264
So what I'll do is I'll actually copy our previous file

33
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,940
for each student test JSP.

34
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,294
I'll simply right click and copy that file.

35
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:49,461
And then likewise I'll right click and do a paste.

36
00:01:50,572 --> 00:01:51,985
And I'll give it a new name here.

37
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:54,402
I'll call it if student test.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,782
And once I'm happy with that name I'll go ahead and

39
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:00,449
click the OK button.

40
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:04,517
Alright.

41
00:02:04,517 --> 00:02:07,602
So now I have this new file here if student test dot JSP.

42
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:10,010
It's basically a copy of our previous file.

43
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,279
We're simply gonna make some enhancements to it.

44
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,047
So everything that you see here is what we did

45
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:15,591
in our previous video.

46
00:02:15,591 --> 00:02:19,987
I wanna move down to this section here for gold customer.

47
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:23,958
So remember, we wanna display a Special Discount if

48
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,291
the user is a gold customer.

49
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:29,324
Alright, so let me give me some space.

50
00:02:29,324 --> 00:02:30,673
Some room to work here.

51
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:32,202
So I make use of the if tag.

52
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:36,177
C colon if test equals and then I put this expression

53
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:37,010
in quotes.

54
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:42,675
So again, JSP will call temp student dot is gold customer.

55
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:48,554
If that returns true then we'll display Special Discount.

56
00:02:48,554 --> 00:02:51,938
If it returns false we won't display anything.

57
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:55,271
So just a very simply if then statement.

58
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:59,389
Alright so let's go ahead and try it out.

59
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:00,943
So I'll save my file.

60
00:03:00,943 --> 00:03:02,256
I move over to the file.

61
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:06,423
I'll do a right click and I'll say run as run on server.

62
00:03:10,764 --> 00:03:11,597
Okay good.

63
00:03:11,597 --> 00:03:13,131
So this is some good results here.

64
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:14,510
So we have our students listed.

65
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,842
And then we have Mary Public and she's a gold customer

66
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:20,592
so it displayed Special Discount.

67
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:23,916
Notice for the other two students

68
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:25,337
it didn't display anything.

69
00:03:25,337 --> 00:03:27,628
And let's just kinda review our data again.

70
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:28,914
And this is our test data.

71
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:31,837
So John, Doe, Maxwelll and Mary Public.

72
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,071
So Mary Public is the only one that's a gold customer.

73
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:36,538
She has a value of true.

74
00:03:36,538 --> 00:03:38,842
And so that's why we have this given display

75
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:40,041
here on the screen.

76
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,758
So this looks really really good so far.

77
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:44,675
So we're making some good progress.

78
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,889
But what I'd like to do is somehow change this to

79
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:51,036
display something if they're not a gold customer.

80
00:03:51,036 --> 00:03:52,751
So how can I do that?

81
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,841
Well, you would normally think you could make use of an

82
00:03:54,841 --> 00:03:58,687
else statement but unfortunately this tag library

83
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,838
doesn't have an else for ifs.

84
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:03,272
So, kinda weird I know.

85
00:04:03,272 --> 00:04:05,816
What we can do is we can just check the inverse.

86
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:09,983
So here I can say test equals not temp gold student.

87
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,037
So basically I'm checking to see

88
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:13,685
if it's not a gold customer.

89
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:16,839
If it's not a gold customer then I'll display something

90
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,672
different.

91
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:19,433
So here I'll just put a little dash meaning just

92
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,524
ya know, nothing.

93
00:04:20,524 --> 00:04:22,335
We can say whatever we wanted to here for the body

94
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:25,527
but I'll just keep it simple and put a dash here.

95
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:28,095
And so this is how we can make use of an else kinda sort

96
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:29,839
kinda doing a hack work around.

97
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,643
But don't worry, in a following video I'll show you

98
00:04:31,643 --> 00:04:34,142
some other options for handling this

99
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:35,519
type of scenario.

100
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,382
But let's go with what we have for right now.

101
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:38,864
So I'll save the file.

102
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:40,508
Move back to my browser.

103
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:43,425
And I will simply refresh the page.

104
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:48,600
Wow, this looks awesome.

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,433
Okay, good.

106
00:04:49,433 --> 00:04:51,666
So now if they're not a gold customer we will display

107
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,958
a dash.

108
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,338
If they are a gold customer

109
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,731
then we display Special Discount.

110
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:57,564
Right.

111
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:58,397
So this is pretty cool.

112
00:04:58,397 --> 00:04:59,768
And you can think of all different types of ways of

113
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:02,729
how you could use this in your application.

114
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:05,896
But this is good so far so great job.
