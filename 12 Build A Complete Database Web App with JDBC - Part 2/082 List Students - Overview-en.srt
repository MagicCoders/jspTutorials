1
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:03,242
<v Narrator>Hey, in this video we're going to look</v>

2
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:05,575
at the list student feature.

3
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:10,358
So, basically in the following set of videos we're

4
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:12,965
going to write all the code to list the students.

5
00:00:12,965 --> 00:00:14,793
So, we're going to talk to the database,

6
00:00:14,793 --> 00:00:16,621
get a list of students, and then we're going to create

7
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,912
this very pretty table of our data,

8
00:00:19,912 --> 00:00:22,034
and I'll show you how to do all of this from scratch.

9
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:25,174
So, we'll just drill down, we'll take it one step at a time,

10
00:00:25,174 --> 00:00:26,546
and we'll work through it.

11
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:29,801
So speaking of steps, you know how I love to do lists.

12
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:33,644
So, I'm going to break this down into four main steps.

13
00:00:33,644 --> 00:00:36,703
So the first step is creating a student class,

14
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,248
student dot java.

15
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:41,167
Then we're going to create our student database utility.

16
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:44,140
Next, we're going to create our controller servlet.

17
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,344
And then finally we'll wrap it up all together

18
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:48,767
with our final JSP page.

19
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,728
Alright so that's the big picture, let's go ahead

20
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:55,895
and dive in and let's start writing some code, yeah.

21
00:01:00,345 --> 00:01:03,091
Alright so moving into Eclipse, we're going to use that

22
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:07,290 line:15% 
project that we've been using already, web student tracker.

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,266 line:15% 
And the first thing we want to do is create this

24
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:12,268 line:15% 
student dot java class, it's simply just a Java class

25
00:01:12,268 --> 00:01:14,828 line:15% 
that's going to hold the student's first name,

26
00:01:14,828 --> 00:01:16,647 line:15% 
last name and email address.

27
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:20,241 line:15% 
So, I'm moving to this Java resources directory,

28
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:24,643 line:15% 
move to my package, and I'll simply do a right click

29
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:26,976
and I'll say new Java class.

30
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:34,861
Alright so that brings up the dialog here,

31
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,694 line:15% 
for the name of the class it's simply student,

32
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:41,855 line:15% 
and once you're happy with that then go ahead

33
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:44,438 line:15% 
and click on the finish button.

34
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:50,769
Alright so we have this very basic student class here,

35
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:54,936 line:15% 
nothing's here, so let's go ahead and define four fields.

36
00:01:56,014 --> 00:02:00,033 line:15% 
So, I'll need a field for the student id,

37
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:02,384 line:15% 
and then I'll also add fields here for the student's

38
00:02:02,384 --> 00:02:06,217 line:15% 
first name, last name, and also email address.

39
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,694 line:15% 
So, this is the basic data that we want to

40
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:14,861 line:15% 
you know keep track of when we're building our application.

41
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:18,738 line:15% 
Okay great, so now we want to create some constructors,

42
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,893 line:15% 
and we'll actually create two constructors,

43
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:23,168
I'll actually make use of Eclipse to help me out

44
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:24,997
with creating the constructors.

45
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:28,200
So first I'll do a right click, I'll go to source and

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,033
I'll choose generate constructor using fields.

47
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:37,489
And Eclipse will pop up a dialog asking me which fields

48
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:40,496
to initialize, make sure they're all selected here

49
00:02:40,496 --> 00:02:42,781
with the check boxes, and then we'll go ahead

50
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:44,992
and click on the finish button.

51
00:02:44,992 --> 00:02:47,616
So this will give me a constructor for all of the fields,

52
00:02:47,616 --> 00:02:49,565
right, so this is really cool, Eclipse created all this

53
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:51,732
code for us automatically.

54
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,913
Alright, and I'll just remove line 11, we don't need that,

55
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,982
and this is basically our constructor.

56
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:03,186
Now I want to add one more constructor here.

57
00:03:03,186 --> 00:03:06,153
So I'll right click, I'll say source, generate constructor

58
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:09,506
using fields, and I want to create a version of the

59
00:03:09,506 --> 00:03:12,411
constructor that doesn't use the id, so I'll simply

60
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:15,862
deselect or uncheck the box for id, but I'll keep

61
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,627
the others for first name, last name, and email address,

62
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:20,689
because there's certain scenarios where we don't have

63
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:24,606
the id or we don't need the id for our student.

64
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,577
Alright so make sure your screen looks like this,

65
00:03:27,577 --> 00:03:29,471
and keep all the other defaults, and then go ahead

66
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,721
and click on the ok button.

67
00:03:37,488 --> 00:03:39,778
Alright, so that's the new constructor that Eclipse

68
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:41,598
just created for us, which is really cool,

69
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,695
first name, last name, and email.

70
00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:46,017
I'll take out that line for the for the super,

71
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,871
and then here's our other guy, so we're good to go.

72
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:50,680
So, we have two constructors now, we have two different

73
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,176
ways of creating this student class,

74
00:03:53,176 --> 00:03:56,343
okay so this looks really good so far.

75
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:00,791 line:15% 
Now what I'd like to do is go through and create getter

76
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,905 line:15% 
and setter methods for this class.

77
00:04:02,905 --> 00:04:05,832 line:15% 
So again, make use of Eclipse, I'll do a right click,

78
00:04:05,832 --> 00:04:09,999 line:15% 
choose source, and go to generate getters and setters.

79
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:14,713
Eclipse will bring up this dialog, and again we go

80
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,295
through and select all the items here, for email,

81
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:18,751
first name, id, and last name.

82
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:21,281
Make sure they're all selected, keep all of the

83
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,261
other defaults, and then go ahead and click

84
00:04:23,261 --> 00:04:24,844
on the okay button.

85
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:30,154
Okay cool, so Eclipse created a lot of getter and setter

86
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:32,544
methods for us, and again this is really fun that

87
00:04:32,544 --> 00:04:37,103
Eclipse is generating code for us, I love that.

88
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:41,518 line:15% 
Now, one last thing I want to do is add a toString method.

89
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:45,611 line:15% 
So, I'll simply do a right click here, I'll choose source

90
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,611 line:15% 
and then I'll say generate toString.

91
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,497 line:15% 
The toString method is very useful for debugging

92
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:54,710
and logging information.

93
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:57,400
So, here I make sure that we have all the fields selected

94
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,105
id, first name, last name, and email, and I'll keep

95
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:02,932
all the other defaults, and then I hit ok.

96
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:05,886
So again, if I need to do some debugging or logging

97
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:08,614
on this application, by having the toString method

98
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:11,824
we can easily get a dump of the students information

99
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,820
without having to manually do it ourselves,

100
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,667
so this is good, so we're in good shape here.

101
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,954
So that's it, that's our student class that we had

102
00:05:18,954 --> 00:05:21,329
four fields that we created, id, first name, last name,

103
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,552
and email, we created constructors, and then we also

104
00:05:24,552 --> 00:05:27,245
created getters and setters, and finally toStrings.

105
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:29,438
This is kind of like some basic house keeping

106
00:05:29,438 --> 00:05:31,694
that we needed to take care of, but we're in really

107
00:05:31,694 --> 00:05:34,027
good shape now, so good job.
