1
00:00:01,367 --> 00:00:02,200
<v Chad Darby>Okay, great.</v>

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,254
So we're making some really good progress right now.

3
00:00:04,254 --> 00:00:06,988
We have this table, but it's kinda ugly,

4
00:00:06,988 --> 00:00:09,222
and what we wanna do is make it pretty.

5
00:00:09,222 --> 00:00:11,277
Like I said earlier, make it beautiful.

6
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,120
So we're gonna make use of cascading style sheets for this.

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,188
Now, we actually have a cascading style sheet

8
00:00:16,188 --> 00:00:18,829
that's available in our starter files.

9
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:20,640
So I'm gonna move back over to my directory,

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,429
where I extracted all of my sample code,

11
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,811
and then there's a directory here

12
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:28,642
called web student tracker starter files.

13
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:31,546
So let's go ahead and expand that folder

14
00:00:31,546 --> 00:00:33,964
and web content, then there's a folder here

15
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:37,243
called CSS, for cascading style sheets.

16
00:00:37,243 --> 00:00:40,634
So, we already have a CSS file that's already created.

17
00:00:40,634 --> 00:00:42,961
So, let's go ahead and select this file.

18
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:45,294
Right click and choose copy.

19
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:53,212
Alright, so we have this file copied.

20
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:55,719
Let's move back into Eclipse, and in Eclipse

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:57,467 line:15% 
what we wanna do is create a new folder

22
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,267 line:15% 
for our cascading style sheets.

23
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,247 line:15% 
So we do a right click, we say new folder,

24
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:03,611 line:15% 
and this is under web content,

25
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:06,249 line:15% 
a new folder called CSS.

26
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:07,999 line:15% 
So, web content, CSS.

27
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:11,108
So we'll hit finish, and now we have

28
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:14,374
this new CSS folder that's underneath web content.

29
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:17,587
Now, this is the folder that we'll paste our file,

30
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:21,623
so we simply go right click and choose paste.

31
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,111
Now, for the CSS file, you could really

32
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:24,583
put it anywhere that you want.

33
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,306
I'm just putting it here in the CSS folder

34
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:28,063
just for organization, but you could put it

35
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:30,665
in any directory at any location that you want

36
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,556
underneath web content.

37
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:34,631
Alright, so here's our styles CSS.

38
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:38,702
Now, full disclaimer, I'm not a CSS guru.

39
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:42,407
I normally have a friend help me out with CSS,

40
00:01:42,407 --> 00:01:44,966
or I normally find examples on the web

41
00:01:44,966 --> 00:01:47,792
and kinda copy paste, so I'm not a graphic designer.

42
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:49,361
But, anyway, this is a basic CSS

43
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:50,949
that can kinda help us out.

44
00:01:50,949 --> 00:01:54,593
Now, let's use the CSS in our JSP page.

45
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:56,703
This is a common question, like how do we use a CSS

46
00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:58,040
in a JSP page?

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,887
So, again, assuming we have the CSS file already created,

48
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:06,186
then in our JSP page it's just like an HTML page, right?

49
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:08,706
So, to use CSS in HTML, you simply put it

50
00:02:08,706 --> 00:02:11,680
the head, same thing here for JSP.

51
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,013
So we set the link type, text slash CSS,

52
00:02:20,914 --> 00:02:23,569
We give the rel of style sheet,

53
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,249
and then we give the href to where

54
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,768
the style sheet's located, so right?

55
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:28,832
So we created this directory called CSS

56
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:31,850
and we had a file here called style dot CSS,

57
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,120
and that's basically a reference there

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,986
to the style sheet.

59
00:02:35,986 --> 00:02:39,453
So, CSS slash style dot CSS, and that's

60
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:41,882
the directory that we have here

61
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:44,613
as part of our project under web content,

62
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:46,196
CSS, style dot CSS.

63
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,225
Now, that style sheet has rules,

64
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:53,175
and I've applied those rules to this actual HTML content,

65
00:02:53,175 --> 00:02:55,351
or this JSP page, and then that will give us

66
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,101
a pretty output here.

67
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,762
So, some of the rules relate to,

68
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:04,218
I'll kinda scroll down here in a second,

69
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,839
so we have styles here for wrapper,

70
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,736
we have styles for header.

71
00:03:07,736 --> 00:03:09,011
We also have styles in that sheet

72
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,481
for container and content.

73
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,592
You can go back and dig into the style sheet

74
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,021
to look at all of those styles.

75
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,213
But, anyway, that's that.

76
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:16,046
It's in place.

77
00:03:16,046 --> 00:03:17,201
We're ready to go.

78
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,039
So, then we can go back to our student tracker,

79
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,372
click the refresh button, and boom, wow.

80
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:25,631
This is great.

81
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,464
So, isn't this great?

82
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:30,004
So we had a very basic, ugly HTML table,

83
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:33,557
and by simply adding CSS styles, now it's pretty.

84
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:34,641
It's beautiful.

85
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:36,114
It's lovely.

86
00:03:36,114 --> 00:03:39,122
Alrighty, so as you can see I'm having a lot of fun here,

87
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:40,496
'cause I'm really excited.

88
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:43,510
We accomplished some really, really good stuff here.

89
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,461
So, anyway, that's kind of full-circle.

90
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:49,398
So we have the list of students feature working.

91
00:03:49,398 --> 00:03:50,764
In the following videos we'll go and add

92
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:51,815
some more functionality.

93
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,983
But for now, take a break, pat yourself on the back,

94
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,150
job well done.
