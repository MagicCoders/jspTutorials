1
00:00:00,797 --> 00:00:02,367
<v Teacher>Alright, so we have our</v>

2
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:03,880
controller servlet completed.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,694
Let's go ahead and focus in on our JSP page now.

4
00:00:07,694 --> 00:00:10,938
So in our project, in our WebContent folder,

5
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:14,325
let's go ahead and create a new file for our JSP.

6
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:18,424
So I'll right-click, I'll say: new, file.

7
00:00:18,424 --> 00:00:19,910
and for the name of the file;

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,660
I'll call it "list-students.jsp".

9
00:00:32,147 --> 00:00:34,655
And once I'm happy with that I'll hit okay,

10
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:36,621
and now we have this empty file here,

11
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:40,843
and we need to go ahead and add some information to it.

12
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:43,284
So the first thing we need to do is our JSP's gonna make

13
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:46,280
use of some Java packages so I need to do an import.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,146
So I need to import java dot util dot star,

15
00:00:49,146 --> 00:00:50,179
because I'm gonna use--

16
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:51,409
list an array list,

17
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:54,560
and also some of my own custom classes from my package;

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,477
com.Luv2code.web.jdbc.*

19
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,929
So this is basically just an import for two packages,

20
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,156
and then remember in JSP

21
00:01:01,156 --> 00:01:03,437
we can import multiple packages

22
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:06,671
by giving a comma with unlimited list of package names.

23
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:08,242
Alright, so we have the packages here,

24
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:11,159
now I'll just do my very basic HTML

25
00:01:12,342 --> 00:01:14,776
setup work, so I'll set up my HTML head,

26
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:17,193
and I'll set up my HTML body.

27
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:24,085
Alright, so we have our general HTML housekeeping

28
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,021
taken care of.

29
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,326
Let me just set up a title here for this page;

30
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:30,159
I'll call it: Student Tracker App.

31
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:35,769
Alright, so that parts taken care of.

32
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:37,640
Now, what I wanna do is actually make use of that

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,590
request object and use some of its data.

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,819
So I'll set up a JSP scriptlet

35
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:44,569
and I want to get the

36
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,832
list of students from that request attribute that was

37
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:50,082
passed over by the servlet.

38
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:56,350
So I know the servlet has a list of students

39
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,081
that it put into that request object

40
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:00,168
so I'll simply say: theStudents equals

41
00:02:00,168 --> 00:02:03,173
and then I'll retrieve that information and I'll downcast

42
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:05,151
it, so I'll say: List Student

43
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:08,318
and I'll say request dot get attribute

44
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,379
and I'll give the attribute name that was used by

45
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,212
the servlet. So it's: student underscore list.

46
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,372
And that will give me a handle to the students.

47
00:02:22,372 --> 00:02:25,067
Now, I always like to go into the servlet source code

48
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:28,105
and just verify that I have the correct attribute name

49
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:30,593
so I'll swing back over to the servlet source code

50
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:32,702
for my student controller servlet,

51
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,391
and I'll move down to the section

52
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:37,392
where we did our request dispatcher and here we go,

53
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:40,456
great. So this line's 58 and 59.

54
00:02:40,456 --> 00:02:42,352
This is where we set the students and

55
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:44,920
the request attribute and note here what's highlighted:

56
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,928
Student underscore list. So that's the same attribute name.

57
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:50,932
So, just make sure you follow that pattern there.

58
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:51,792
Student underscore list.

59
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:52,625
Good.

60
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:55,625
So now we have the list of students.

61
00:02:58,421 --> 00:03:00,472
So let me stretch out and get some white space here.

62
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,362
And now what I always like to do is just a very simple

63
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:05,609
proof of concept, that hey, we can get the data.

64
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:08,869
So, before I get into displaying the actual

65
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:11,446
HTML table, I just want to dump out those students,

66
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:14,694
just so it can print the information to the browser,

67
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,750
just to make sure that hey,

68
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,368
we can actually get some data.

69
00:03:17,368 --> 00:03:18,801
And the output will be ugly,

70
00:03:18,801 --> 00:03:20,979
but at least we can verify that we have data

71
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,312
right now from that servlet.

72
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:26,823
So let me go ahead and run this servlet,

73
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:29,055
so student controller servlet,

74
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:30,055
right-click.

75
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,827
I'll choose run as, and I'll choose run on server.

76
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:45,837
Alright, so here's the output, so our servlet just ran

77
00:03:45,837 --> 00:03:48,763
so again, remember our servlet talks to the database util

78
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:50,204
gets that list of students,

79
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:51,454
forwards it over to the JSP

80
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:53,572
and right now our JSP is just very simple.

81
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:55,291
We're just dumping out the list of students,

82
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:57,689
and again, it's really really ugly right now.

83
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,346
(laughs)

84
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,820
<v ->But don't worry, we'll actually get into all the</v>

85
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,769
HTML table stuff. Again, I just like to make sure that

86
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,625
we can get the data and we can get it to the JSP.

87
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,144
Now, this is just more of a-- making things

88
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:14,990
look pretty inside the house right now, that's all.

89
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,944
Alright, so let's go ahead and move back into our JSP.

90
00:04:16,944 --> 00:04:21,364
And now we actually want to build the HTML table.

91
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:24,318
And so I'll kinda work on my HTML page.

92
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:26,633
We'll actually make use of some style sheets a little later

93
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,973
on, but for now, I'll go ahead and just kinda lay out

94
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:32,315
some of the content here for this HTML page

95
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:37,190
and we'll apply some styles in the following video.

96
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:39,337
Alright, so here I'll just set up some div's.

97
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:41,594
So div's are basically just little containers or

98
00:04:41,594 --> 00:04:43,965
placeholders for putting information or

99
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:47,397
managing information on an HTML page.

100
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:49,185
So we're going to use style sheets later,

101
00:04:49,185 --> 00:04:50,826
so I'm just going to make use of some div's

102
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:52,726
for the wrapper, for the header.

103
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,893
So our header will show up, h2 as: Foobar University

104
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,222
and again, stretch out, get some white space here.

105
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:04,847
Then I'll go ahead and start working on

106
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,514
my main content div.

107
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:10,470
So this is my container here.

108
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:18,360
And then the div for this one will be: content,

109
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,885
and again, we'll apply-- CSS styles for these

110
00:05:22,885 --> 00:05:26,181
given items, but for now, we're just laying it out.

111
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:28,252
The main part here is just focusing on

112
00:05:28,252 --> 00:05:30,288
building out our table. So we want to have an

113
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:33,839
HTML table that'll give the students:

114
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,172
First name, last name and email address.

115
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:40,266
So to handle that, I'll first-- in my table here,

116
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:43,121
I'll set up a table-row and I'll set up a table header

117
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:45,186
so just so we can see the actual headers here,

118
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:46,353
for the table.

119
00:05:47,454 --> 00:05:50,531
So again, we'll have: first name,

120
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,387
and I just copy/paste this line.

121
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:55,284
And then paste that a couple of times here,

122
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:57,353
and then here, we'll have it for last name,

123
00:05:57,353 --> 00:06:00,520
and then we'll also have it for email.

124
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:07,365
Okay, great. So this takes care of our headers right now

125
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:11,198
for our HTML table. So this looks good so far.

126
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:14,173
Now, what I wanna do is, move down a bit,

127
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:17,439
and then I actually loop through that list of students

128
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,810
and put this information in different table rows.

129
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,514
So here I'll just do a "for" loop, I'll say:

130
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:27,097
student, temp student. Colon, the students.

131
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,234
Now the students; you may wonder well where did

132
00:06:30,234 --> 00:06:33,975
that come from? Well that's the variable that we

133
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:36,514
set up earlier in this JSP page.

134
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:38,360
So on line 11, we have "the students";

135
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,153
that's the list that we retrieved from that

136
00:06:40,153 --> 00:06:43,393
request attribute. So that's the list of students

137
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:46,226
that we're looping over right now.

138
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:50,684
So I just have my open curly brace and my close

139
00:06:50,684 --> 00:06:53,542
curly brace, and then basically inside of this loop

140
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,415
this is where we're gonna print out the students

141
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,902
first name, last name and email address.

142
00:06:58,902 --> 00:07:02,583
So I'll set up a table row for this

143
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,479
and then I'll set up table data.

144
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:06,485
So table data,

145
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,043
I'll make use of a JSP expression, so angle bracket, percent

146
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:10,633
with an equal, and I'll say

147
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:13,300
temp student dot get first name.

148
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:18,694
So that'll get me the first name for the student

149
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:20,689
and then I'll copy this line and I'll paste it

150
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,606
a couple of times here,

151
00:07:24,247 --> 00:07:25,409
and so here I'll have a

152
00:07:25,409 --> 00:07:28,659
get last name, and then also get email.

153
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:35,169
Alright, good, so there's the email portion of it.

154
00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:38,588
So that's basically the looping portion here

155
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:39,755
for our table.

156
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:43,926
So this looks really good,

157
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:46,554
so here's our table, we have our table headers up top

158
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,820
and then we looped that list of students

159
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,265
and we print out the first name, last name and

160
00:07:51,265 --> 00:07:53,919
email address. So this looks really, really good.

161
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,669
I'm excited about this right now.

162
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,756
Alright so, let's save it and let's test it out.

163
00:08:01,756 --> 00:08:04,171
So all I have to do is go back to my previous

164
00:08:04,171 --> 00:08:06,944
screen here, my browser screen here for the servlet

165
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,884
and all I have to do is simply reload.

166
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:11,566
Remember with JSP's if you change it,

167
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,276
there's no need to re-run the code,

168
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:15,154
you simply just refresh and there you go,

169
00:08:15,154 --> 00:08:17,555
so bam! I love this.

170
00:08:17,555 --> 00:08:19,892
So here's our table for FooBar University,

171
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:21,872
we have our five students listed out,

172
00:08:21,872 --> 00:08:23,803
so this is really, really cool

173
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:27,213
so we have this information in tabular data.

174
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:28,857
Now, it's a little ugly right now

175
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,770
(laughs)

176
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,952
the table is kinda plain, it's kinda blah,

177
00:08:32,952 --> 00:08:36,217
it doesn't really match the screenshots we had earlier.

178
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:37,608
But don't worry,

179
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:41,209
in the following video, I'll show you how to apply

180
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,574
Cascading Style Sheets to this table,

181
00:08:43,574 --> 00:08:45,159
to make it look pretty.

182
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,745
To make it look beautiful.

183
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:47,851
(laughs)

184
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:49,515
Alright, So I'm having a lot of fun here.

185
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,887
So, in the next video, we'll cover CSS

186
00:08:51,887 --> 00:08:54,103
and I'll show you how to apply those styles

187
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,652
in our JSP page.

188
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:57,985
Alright, I'll see you soon.
