1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,726
<v luv2Code>Hi, in this video we're gonna add JSTL support</v>

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:05,809
to our classroom project.

3
00:00:09,282 --> 00:00:11,699
So far we've built our MVC framework

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:14,121
but you may have noticed when I was writing the code for

5
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:17,131
the JSP, that I made use of Scriptlet code.

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,264
ohh

7
00:00:18,264 --> 00:00:22,092
And you may have wondered 'Why not add JSTL?'

8
00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,315
So, you may remember from some previous sessions

9
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,836
I covered JSTL and how the best practice is to replace

10
00:00:27,836 --> 00:00:30,695
Scriptlet code with JSTL tags,

11
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:34,730
um so I think that I should follow my own advice here.

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,804
Or, I should practice what I preach.

13
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,141
So in this video we will actually replace our

14
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,558
JSP Scriptlet code with JSTL.

15
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:46,444
And, you know how I love To Do lists here.

16
00:00:46,444 --> 00:00:48,558
So what we're gonna do in step one is that

17
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,778
we're gonna add our JSTL JAR files to our project.

18
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:56,332
Then we'll go through and we'll update our JSP page

19
00:00:56,332 --> 00:00:58,820
to make use of the JSTL tags,

20
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,331
and in particular we'll make use of the &lt;c:forEach&gt; tag

21
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:03,548
And that's really all we have to do

22
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:06,208
all the servlet and database code stays the same,

23
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,125
we're simply updating the JSP page.

24
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:13,601 line:15% 
Alright so lets go ahead and move into Eclipse.

25
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:15,382 line:15% 
So the first step is adding

26
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:18,132 line:15% 
the JSTL JAR files to our project

27
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,442 line:15% 
Now we're going to add these files

28
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:23,460 line:15% 
into our WEB-INF/lib directory, and

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,611 line:15% 
remember the WEB-INF/lib directory is a special directory

30
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:29,405 line:15% 
where you place any third party JAR files.

31
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:32,467 line:15% 
So, as you see we're making use of this JDBC driver

32
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,524 line:15% 
and its already there in our lib directory.

33
00:01:34,524 --> 00:01:37,941 line:15% 
So now we want to add the JSTL JAR files.

34
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:43,346
So I'll swing over to my finder or explorer here,

35
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,898
and moving back to the code we downloaded

36
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,534
earlier in the course, we have a directory here

37
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:51,701
for web student tracker starter files.

38
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:58,737
So I'll expand the directory down to WebContent/WEB-INF/lib

39
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:03,530
and in this directory we have two JAR files that we need.

40
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,346
We have two JSTL JAR files,

41
00:02:06,346 --> 00:02:07,915
so what you should do is go ahead

42
00:02:07,915 --> 00:02:09,651
and select both of those files,

43
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:12,303
do a right click and choose copy,

44
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:15,386
coz those are the files that we want.

45
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,419 line:15% 
Okay, great. So those files are copied

46
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,919 line:15% 
now lets move back over to the Eclipse and

47
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,989 line:15% 
in Eclipse we want to place this information into

48
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:30,682 line:15% 
the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory

49
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:34,849 line:15% 
and then simply do a right click and choose paste.

50
00:02:40,545 --> 00:02:41,569
Okay, this looks really good now.

51
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:44,699
So we should have those two new JAR files for JSTL

52
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:46,464
in our WEB-INF/lb directory.

53
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:47,297
So this is really good,

54
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:49,637
so we're kind set up now with step one

55
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:53,804
so we've added those JAR files and we're ready to go.

56
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:57,293 line:15% 
Alright, so moving forward here on the next step

57
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:58,883 line:15% 
we want to update our JSP page

58
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:01,636 line:15% 
to make use of those JSTL tags.

59
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:05,803 line:15% 
So let me go ahead and open my file list-students.jsp

60
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:08,949 line:15% 
Currently we have Scriptlet code here

61
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:13,670 line:15% 
we're gonna make some modifications to this file.

62
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,947
So the first thing want to do is, on line one,

63
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:19,662
I want to move or delete this line of doing the page import

64
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,430
When we're using JSTL we don't have to any

65
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,479
imports here of java class libraries.

66
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,062
So I'll delete that file.

67
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:29,248
And now what I'm gonna do, is add in the reference here

68
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:32,319
for the JSTL tag libs for core.

69
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,066
So I just did a copy paste here,

70
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:35,429
you can go ahead and type it in,

71
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:36,970
just pause the video and type it in,

72
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,841
but I always like to make sure I get this right

73
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:41,329
because the uri has to match exactly or else

74
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:42,936
everything else will fall apart.

75
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:47,019
So make sure you get the first line correct here.

76
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:49,395
Okay so then we can move down

77
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,316
So we have this section of code here for a Scriptlet

78
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,316 line:15% 
where we would retrieve the object

79
00:03:54,316 --> 00:03:56,618 line:15% 
from other request attributes.

80
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:58,618 line:15% 
We're actually gonna delete this because we don't have to

81
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,785 line:15% 
use it when we make use of JSTL

82
00:04:00,785 --> 00:04:03,077 line:15% 
so JSTL will do a lot of this work for us

83
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,957 line:15% 
behind the scenes.

84
00:04:04,957 --> 00:04:08,142 line:15% 
So lines 12 through 16 I can simply highlight them

85
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:10,475 line:15% 
and just hit the delete key.

86
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:12,405
And, boof! Goes away.

87
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:14,783
(chuckles)

88
00:04:14,783 --> 00:04:17,229
Alright, now lets scroll on down here

89
00:04:17,229 --> 00:04:19,395 line:15% 
and the next thing we want to do here is we actually

90
00:04:19,395 --> 00:04:23,805 line:15% 
want to replace our Scriptlet code with JSTL &lt;c:forEach&gt;.

91
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,562 line:15% 
So on line 32, instead of having a normal

92
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:30,729 line:15% 
for loop using Scriptlet code, I'm going to have a JSTL tag.

93
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:36,984 line:15% 
And, I'm going to put in here for the JSTL &lt;c:forEach&gt; tag.

94
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:42,655 line:15% 
Then I'll grab the end tag and I'll move it down to line 42

95
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,155 line:15% 
Actually, line 41,

96
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:46,563 line:15% 
and I'll place it right there

97
00:04:46,563 --> 00:04:48,571 line:15% 
just so we have a start for each tag

98
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,830 line:15% 
and an end for each tag.

99
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,137 line:15% 
Now I need to go ahead and flesh out some items here

100
00:04:53,137 --> 00:04:56,426 line:15% 
so var="tempStudent", that's our temporary variable we use

101
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:58,221 line:15% 
when we go through the loop.

102
00:04:58,221 --> 00:05:01,503 line:15% 
And then items='' will actually be the attribute name

103
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:02,929 line:15% 
of the data.

104
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:04,389 line:15% 
So this is the same attribute name

105
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:07,759
that was set by the Servlet STUDENT_LIST

106
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,046
so this JSTL tag they'll actually go into that

107
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:12,436
request attribute, or sorry,

108
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,500
they'll actually go into that request object

109
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,923
get the attribute called STUDENT_LIST

110
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:18,604
and then make it available.

111
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:21,097
So they'll do a lot of the work for us behind the scenes

112
00:05:21,097 --> 00:05:24,180
which is a nice feature here of JSTL.

113
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:29,310
Alright great, so now what I'm gonna do here

114
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,239
is replace my

115
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,739
JSP Scriptlet expressions here

116
00:05:33,743 --> 00:05:37,397
and I'll replace it with a JSP expression language

117
00:05:37,397 --> 00:05:39,276
So, that's the dollar sign curly brace

118
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:42,344
and you simply give the object name dot the property name.

119
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:45,031
So here I have tempStudent.firstName

120
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:47,563
so then I'll just copy this line

121
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:50,878
and I'll simply paste it for all the others real quick

122
00:05:50,878 --> 00:05:52,557
so I'll just copy this

123
00:05:52,557 --> 00:05:55,647
and then I'll just paste it here for lastName

124
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,397
and I'll paste it here for email.

125
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,553
And I'll go through and do a quick update here,

126
00:06:01,553 --> 00:06:03,470
so tempStudent.lastName

127
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:07,036
and I'll do tempStudent.email.

128
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:12,834
So as a reminder,

129
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,918
when we use this JSP expression langauge,

130
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:18,808
remember that it will actually call tempStudent.getemail

131
00:06:18,808 --> 00:06:22,480
so it will actually call your getter method here for email.

132
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,421
So tempStudent.getemail,

133
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:27,962
it will do a similar thing for firstName, lastName and so on

134
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:29,545
So that's basically our for-loop now

135
00:06:29,545 --> 00:06:32,319
so instead of using JSP Scriptlet here

136
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,075
we're making use of the JSTL tags

137
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:37,222
and making use of the &lt;c:forEach&gt; tags.

138
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,186
So, just kinda cleaned it up a bit.

139
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:41,343
Not much of a big deal there.

140
00:06:41,343 --> 00:06:43,468
Alright so lets go ahead and try this out and run it.

141
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:46,650
So I need to go back and run my actual

142
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,751
Servlet here, our controller servlet.

143
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:52,668
So, move back up my java resources.

144
00:06:55,652 --> 00:06:58,820
Right click on that StudentControllerServlet.java

145
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:02,737
And then select Run As, and then Run on Server.

146
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:06,296
And break.

147
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:07,129
So that's the output, so again no surprises here

148
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:10,617
everything is going to work exactly the same,

149
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:12,702
the only difference is that we simply modified

150
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:15,084
our JSP page to make use of JSTL.

151
00:07:15,084 --> 00:07:17,312
But to the end user, no real difference,

152
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,866
everything still looks fine,

153
00:07:18,866 --> 00:07:23,286
everything still looks beautiful our beautiful table again.

154
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:27,274
Alright so that covers it here, we went through and we

155
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,984
took our JSP Scriptlet code, removed it

156
00:07:29,984 --> 00:07:33,438
and we replaced it with JSTL tags

157
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:38,140
So good job so far and good job for following best practices

158
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,022
Including myself

159
00:07:39,022 --> 00:07:40,462
(chuckles)

160
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:43,379
