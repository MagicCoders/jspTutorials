1
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:03,423
<v Instructor>Hi, I this video we're gonna learn</v>

2
00:00:03,423 --> 00:00:06,840
about adding welcome files with servlets.

3
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:11,538
So currently, in order to access our MVC application

4
00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:14,542
we have to explicitly call the servlet URL.

5
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:16,909
So we give localhost, web student tracker,

6
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:19,371
slash student controller servlet

7
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:21,808
and that's fine for development and testing

8
00:00:21,808 --> 00:00:25,416
but not really good for real world development

9
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,312
or real world deployment.

10
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:29,052
So, what I'd like to do is make things

11
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:30,806
just a little bit simpler

12
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:33,470
by simply just giving the URL to the web app

13
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,464
without having to explicitly call the servlet.

14
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:38,086
So, I'd like to take this URL

15
00:00:38,086 --> 00:00:39,978
and be able to share it with somebody

16
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:41,846
without getting into all the gory details

17
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:44,346
of student control or servlet.

18
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:49,435
So, what you can do is make use of a feature

19
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,793
with the Java servlets or web apps

20
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:54,353
where there's a deployment descriptor file

21
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:57,467
called web.xml and it has various configs

22
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,057
for application deployment.

23
00:00:59,057 --> 00:01:02,742
So, one of the options available is welcome files.

24
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:04,812
So this will basically tell the server,

25
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:08,971
hey, if no one accesses a servlet or file directly,

26
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,878
then go look for these welcome files

27
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:13,128
and serve those up instead.

28
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:19,923
So, basically it's gonna look for a welcome file

29
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:22,904
and it'll look for that welcome file in your web.xml file.

30
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:24,583
So you have this welcome file list

31
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,666
and you'll have a list of files.

32
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:30,760
Now, it's actually gonna search these files top down,

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,000
So it'll come through.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,878
It'll say hey is there an index.html.

35
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:36,387
If so, it'll serve it up.

36
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,158
You can add as many welcome files here as you'd like.

37
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:41,504
You can also add references to servlets here

38
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:42,933
and this is what it'll look for

39
00:01:42,933 --> 00:01:46,537
as far as a welcome file if the URL doesn't have

40
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:48,577
an explicit file reference.

41
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:49,851
So this is kind of cool.

42
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,501
So that's kind of the theory,

43
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:55,501
let's swing into Eclipse and let's try this out.

44
00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:58,527 line:15% 
So first off before we get into coding

45
00:01:58,527 --> 00:02:00,858 line:15% 
I just wanna show you what'll happen here

46
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,551 line:15% 
if we don't have a file reference.

47
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:05,234 line:15% 
So, note the URL, I have the big, long URL

48
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:07,283 line:15% 
with student controller servlet.

49
00:02:07,283 --> 00:02:09,242 line:15% 
I'm gonna simply take that off

50
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:10,784 line:15% 
and just try and access my app directly

51
00:02:10,784 --> 00:02:12,930 line:15% 
and I'll just hit the enter button.

52
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,221 line:15% 
And ugh yucky, we have this 404 error.

53
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,830 line:15% 
So basically it wasn't able to find a resource

54
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,395 line:15% 
because right now, this web app

55
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:23,949 line:15% 
doesn't have any welcome files to find or configure.

56
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,949 line:15% 
So, we need to fix that.

57
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,240
So in order to fix it,

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,519
we first need to add a web.xml file to our project

59
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,386
and configure it properly.

60
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,822
So I'll move back into our starter files.

61
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,252
I'll move into this directory here, WEB-INF

62
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:43,681
and I'll select this file web.xml.

63
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:47,637
I'll do a right click and I'll copy this file.

64
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,512
Then I'll move back over to Eclipse

65
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:52,357
and then I'll actually paste this file

66
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:54,482
into my WEB-INF directory.

67
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:57,691
So I'll paste it into WebContent/WEB-INF.

68
00:02:57,691 --> 00:02:59,941
So that's the web.xml file.

69
00:03:02,298 --> 00:03:04,154
And once I paste this new file here

70
00:03:04,154 --> 00:03:06,169
I need to restart Tomcat,

71
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,860
just so it'll pick up these new configurations

72
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,277
for this project.

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,526
So you can just simply choose your Tomcat server,

74
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:16,859
right click, choose restart.

75
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:21,374
Alright, so WebContent, WEB-INF, web.xml,

76
00:03:21,374 --> 00:03:23,148
double click it.

77
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:25,091
So here's the file that we had from the slides.

78
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,397
So basically it's just a web deployment descriptor

79
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:30,333 line:15% 
and it has those welcome files.

80
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:33,100 line:15% 
What I wanna do here is create a new welcome file

81
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,344 line:15% 
called index.html.

82
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:36,556 line:15% 
So I wanna solve the problem

83
00:03:36,556 --> 00:03:38,147 line:15% 
that we were having a little earlier.

84
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:41,147 line:15% 
So, creating a new file, index.html.

85
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:48,267 line:15% 
Enter it here and once I'm happy with that file name,

86
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:51,755 line:15% 
I can go ahead and click on the finish button.

87
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,568 line:15% 
Okay great so blank file.

88
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:57,411 line:15% 
So let's just create a very simple html file

89
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:01,425 line:15% 
and with the body I'll set up just some very basic text,

90
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:03,810 line:15% 
Hello Brave New World.

91
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,236 line:15% 
Brave new world,

92
00:04:05,236 --> 00:04:08,486 line:15% 
and I'll set up some h1 tags around it.

93
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,180 line:15% 
Alright, so just a very basic Hello World page.

94
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,680 line:15% 
Right, I'll save this file.

95
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,899 line:15% 
Now if I go back to my browser

96
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,955 line:15% 
I should be able to test this out.

97
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:25,968
So in my browser, instead of the 404 error,

98
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:28,801
if I click on reload for this URL,

99
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:32,107
then boom, good job.

100
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:35,455
So now I'm getting that html file that I just added

101
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,147
and that's because this index.html

102
00:04:38,147 --> 00:04:40,811
that's listed as a welcome file

103
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:42,394
in my web.xml file.

104
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,873
So the system it went through looking for some file.

105
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:48,244
It looked for index.jsp, it didn't find it

106
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:50,822
and it looked for index.html, found one

107
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:53,055
and that's the file that it served up.

108
00:04:53,055 --> 00:04:54,498
So this was working out really good.

109
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:57,893
So we have the basics going here for our welcome files.

110
00:04:57,893 --> 00:04:59,560
So, good job so far.

111
00:05:02,645 --> 00:05:04,077 line:15% 
But I really want more.

112
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:05,295 line:15% 
I don't want just the hello world,

113
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:07,224 line:15% 
I want my servlet, okay,

114
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,433 line:15% 
I want my student controller servlet.

115
00:05:09,433 --> 00:05:11,366 line:15% 
So what I'll do is I'll actually add the servlet

116
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:12,633 line:15% 
as a welcome file.

117
00:05:12,633 --> 00:05:16,251 line:15% 
So I'll simply grab the URL mapping for this servlet,

118
00:05:16,251 --> 00:05:17,251 line:15% 
I'll copy it

119
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,639 line:15% 
and then I'll use that in that web.xml

120
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,410 line:15% 
for setting up a references to a welcome file.

121
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,191 line:15% 
So I'll move here into this web.xml

122
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,661 line:15% 
and I'll add a new entry here for our welcome file

123
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,987 line:15% 
and so instead of giving and actual file name

124
00:05:33,987 --> 00:05:36,416 line:15% 
like a jsp or a html file,

125
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:38,884 line:15% 
I'll give the URL mapping of my servlet.

126
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:40,340 line:15% 
Student controller servlet

127
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,870 line:15% 
and it's listed first.

128
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,812 line:15% 
So it should pick that one up

129
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:45,187 line:15% 
before it makes it to the html page.

130
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:46,474 line:15% 
So just be careful on the order.

131
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:49,891 line:15% 
Remember it'll search for files top-down.

132
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,965
Again, go through and just refresh

133
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:55,394
or restart this Tomcat server

134
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:59,561
because we made some config changes to our web.xml file.

135
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,089
Alright, so now that Tomcat is restarted,

136
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:04,778
then I can go back into my browser

137
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,689
and test some things out.

138
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,856
So here I click on refresh

139
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:12,720
and booya,

140
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:17,520
now, note the URL is just web-student-tracker,

141
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,317
but behind the scenes it's automatically forwarding

142
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:23,593
or calling our student controller servlet.

143
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:24,426
So this looks great.

144
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,228
So there's no servlet reference in the URL.

145
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:28,635
But it's basically being served up,

146
00:06:28,635 --> 00:06:31,764
processing all of our big MVC stuff

147
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:33,610
is working in the background

148
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,859
thanks to our database work.

149
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:35,965
So, this is great

150
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:37,459
so I just wanted to show you this little trick here

151
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:40,499
for making use of welcome files here

152
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:41,916
with the web.xml.

153
00:06:42,895 --> 00:06:44,395
Alright, good job.
