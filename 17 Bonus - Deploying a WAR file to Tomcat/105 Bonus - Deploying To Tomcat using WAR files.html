</strong></p><p>When you deploy your Java web apps, you can make use of a Web Application Archive (WAR) file.</p>

<p>The Web Application Archive (WAR) file is a compressed version of your web application. It uses the zip file format but the file has the .war extension.</p>

<p>If you are using Eclipse, then the best way to visualize it is think of your "WebContent" directory being compressed as a zip file with the .war extension.</p>

<p>This includes all of your web pages, images, css etc. It also includes the WEB-INF directory which includes your classes in WEB-INF/classes and supporting JAR files in WEB-INF/lib.</p>

<p>The WAR file format is part of the Java EE / Servlet specification. As a result, all Java EE servers support this format (ie jboss, weblogic, websphere, glassfish and tomcat).</p>

<p>Below, I provide the steps on how to create a WAR file in Eclipse. I also show how to deploy the WAR file on Tomcat.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>1. In Eclipse, stop Tomcat</p>

<p>2. Right-click your project and select Export &gt; WAR File</p>

<p>3. In the Destination field, enter: &lt;any-directory&gt;/mycoolapp.war</p>

<p>4. Outside of Eclipse, start Tomcat<br>- If you are using MS Windows, then you should find it on the Start menu</p>

<p>5. Make sure Tomcat is up and running by visiting: http://localhost:8080</p>

<p>6. Deploy your new WAR file by copying it to &lt;tomcat-install-directory&gt;\webapps</p>

<p>Give it about 10-15 seconds to make the deployment. You'll know the deployment is over because you'll see a new folder created in webapps ... with your WAR file name.</p>

<p>7. Visit your new app. If your war file was: mycoolapp.war then you can access it with:Â  http://localhost:8080/mycoolapp/</p></p>
