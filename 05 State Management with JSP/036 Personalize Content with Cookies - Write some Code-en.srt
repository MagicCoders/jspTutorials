1
00:00:01,582 --> 00:00:03,617
<v Instructor>Hey, so let's go ahead and move into Eclipse</v>

2
00:00:03,617 --> 00:00:05,534
and let's start coding.

3
00:00:07,406 --> 00:00:08,970 line:15% 
So, the first thing I wanna do is actually

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,519 line:15% 
create a new file.

5
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,200
So I'll move down to this WebContent directory,

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,450
and I'll create a new file.

7
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,291
So I'll say New, File,

8
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:26,098
and for the actual file name,

9
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:29,598
I'll choose cookies-personalize-form.html.

10
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,502
This will be our HTML form for personalizing the website.

11
00:00:34,502 --> 00:00:35,437
Once we're happy with that name,

12
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:37,604
we'll go and click Finish.

13
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:44,766
All right, so in this file,

14
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:47,606
I'll just go ahead and write out my basic HTML

15
00:00:47,606 --> 00:00:50,622
header information in my HTML body.

16
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:51,667
For the header, I'll just go ahead

17
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:53,530
and set up a title real quick,

18
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,197
Personalize The Site

19
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,289
and that's my basic housekeeping.

20
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:04,114
Now I'll actually go through and build out the form.

21
00:01:04,114 --> 00:01:05,288
So, I'll set up my form,

22
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:09,455
I'll set action equals to cookies-personalize-response.jsp.

23
00:01:13,652 --> 00:01:15,466
And so, now I'll just kind of build out my form.

24
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,797
First off I'll prompt the user hey,

25
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:19,187
select your favorite programming language

26
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:21,204
and I'll set up a dropdown list

27
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:23,005
or a select item,

28
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:24,012
so we've seen this before,

29
00:01:24,012 --> 00:01:26,398
so I set the name equals favoriteLanguage

30
00:01:26,398 --> 00:01:28,129
and then I just drop in those languages,

31
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,962
Java, C#, PHP and Ruby

32
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,106
and again, we've seen all this before.

33
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:38,845
Now one more thing I need to do

34
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:41,512
with this form is set up my Submit button.

35
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:42,553
So, I'll move down here,

36
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:44,971
I'll say input type equals submit

37
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:47,388
and then value equals Submit.

38
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:51,736
And that's basically it here for our form,

39
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,641
just prompting the user

40
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:54,719
for their favorite programming language

41
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:57,552
and then having our Submit button.

42
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:04,117
All right, so we can go ahead and save that file

43
00:02:04,117 --> 00:02:06,195
and let's just do a quick test on it

44
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:07,551
just to make sure it works out,

45
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:10,984
so I'll just choose this cookies-personalize-form.html

46
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:13,202
and I'll just say run on Server

47
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:14,800
and this looks pretty good, so great,

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,440
there's our prompt, there's our dropdown list

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,273
and our Submit button,

50
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:19,856
so this part looks okay so far.

51
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,104 line:15% 
So, moving ahead to step two,

52
00:02:27,104 --> 00:02:30,202 line:15% 
I need to create another new file.

53
00:02:30,202 --> 00:02:31,807
This file is gonna be our response page,

54
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:35,890
so I'll call it cookies-personalize-repsonse.jsp.

55
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,454
And once I'm happy with that name,

56
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:46,204
I'll go ahead and click on the Finish button.

57
00:02:49,392 --> 00:02:53,559
All right, so this JSP basically is gonna read the form data

58
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:58,463
and then also create cookies or set cookies

59
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,958
and pass them back to the browser,

60
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,701
so again, let me go ahead and do my basic housekeeping here

61
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:04,701
for the HTML

62
00:03:05,649 --> 00:03:07,429
and then I'm going to set up a scriplet

63
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:09,402
for my angle bracket percent.

64
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:11,596
The first thing I need to do is read the form data,

65
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:13,916
so I'm going to read that form field favoriteLanguage

66
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,666
that we had in the previous file.

67
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:19,498
Now that I have that actual favoriteLanguage,

68
00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:21,887
now what I'm going to do is create a cookie,

69
00:03:21,887 --> 00:03:24,419
so I'll say theCookie equals new Cookie

70
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:26,526
and I give that name value pair,

71
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:28,621
so name of myApp.favoriteLanguage

72
00:03:28,621 --> 00:03:31,115
and then the value is favLang.

73
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:32,435
So, now now that I have a cookie created,

74
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:34,910
next I need to actually set the lifespan

75
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,357
on the cookie, so I'll say theCookie.setMaxAge

76
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:40,420
and this is the ugly part again remember,

77
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,203
you have to give the total number of seconds

78
00:03:43,203 --> 00:03:46,014
and so, I did the math and that's the total number

79
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:48,250
of seconds for one year.

80
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,239
Once we have that taken care of,

81
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:52,568
then we simply need to send the cookie to the browser

82
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:55,532
and we do that by doing a response.addCookie

83
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:58,690
and then giving a reference to that cookie object

84
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,340
and that's basically it for this step two

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,433
of reading the form data

86
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,766
and then setting the cookie.

87
00:04:11,497 --> 00:04:12,942
So, now what we wanna do is go through

88
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,414
and just put our body in here,

89
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:16,446
so this body is mainly just a confirmation

90
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,593
just to echo whatever the user entered,

91
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,355
so here I'll say hey thanks, we set your favorite language

92
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:24,504
to and then we just drop in that parameter information,

93
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:27,928
so I'll use the dollar sign param.favoriteLanguage.

94
00:04:27,928 --> 00:04:29,891
And then at the bottom I'm gonna set up a link

95
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,495
back to the home page,

96
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:33,536
so I'll say set up an href

97
00:04:33,536 --> 00:04:35,517
and I'll say return to homepage

98
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:37,900
so that way they can make it back to the home page

99
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,088
and then see their new customized content.

100
00:04:41,088 --> 00:04:42,122
So, this part's all laid out

101
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:44,039
for this response page.

102
00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,335
And so, I think this pretty much covers everything

103
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:49,418
for step two.

104
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,627
All right, so let's go ahead and take care of step three.

105
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:03,544
So, let's go ahead and create a new file again,

106
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:13,053
and the name of this file is cookies-homepage.jsp,

107
00:05:13,053 --> 00:05:14,978
so this is our main JSP page

108
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:18,007
that's gonna display the personalized content.

109
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,539
All right, once we have that file name entered,

110
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:22,622
go ahead and click the Finish button.

111
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:30,752
And I'll kind of expand my window here for a second.

112
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:34,335
So again, normal housekeeping for the HTML.

113
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:36,972
So, basically here I'll set up a header,

114
00:05:36,972 --> 00:05:38,305
Training Portal,

115
00:05:41,611 --> 00:05:44,492
and now I wanna first off read

116
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:46,139
the favorite programming language cookie,

117
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,694
so I'll drop in a little scriplet code here.

118
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:51,606
First off, I'll set up a default,

119
00:05:51,606 --> 00:05:52,812
so if there are no cookies,

120
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:56,979
the favorite language is just gonna default to Java.

121
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:00,036
Then next I'm actually gonna get the cookies

122
00:06:00,036 --> 00:06:01,817
from that request object,

123
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,394
so remember, it's going to return an array,

124
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:06,318
so I'll say cookie with a square brackets for an array

125
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:08,485
equals request.getCookies.

126
00:06:13,059 --> 00:06:15,087
So, next I simply just need to loop through

127
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:16,786
and find our favorite language cookie,

128
00:06:16,786 --> 00:06:17,867
so here I check to make sure

129
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:19,810
that cookies is not equal to null

130
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,768
and then I set up a for loop.

131
00:06:22,768 --> 00:06:26,268
So, I have for Cookie tempCookie : cookies

132
00:06:30,266 --> 00:06:32,177
and now I basically just want to check

133
00:06:32,177 --> 00:06:33,556
the name of each cookie

134
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:36,469
to see if they're equal to our favorite language,

135
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:38,886
so equals tempCookie.getName.

136
00:06:41,876 --> 00:06:44,243
If that's true then we can get the actual value

137
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:46,690
of that cookie, that's our favoriteLanguage,

138
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,188
so favLang equals tempCookie,getvalue

139
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:50,114
and then break

140
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:52,250
and I actually have a typo here.

141
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,184
Cookies is incorrect.

142
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:56,682
This should actually be theCookies

143
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,692
because that's the array of cookies

144
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:00,820
that we received from the previous line,

145
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,723
so good, I fixed that typo.

146
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:03,556
Good job.

147
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:07,346
All right, so this looks good so far,

148
00:07:07,346 --> 00:07:09,875
so we can save this file

149
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:13,260
and this part of it basically handles reading

150
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,677
that favoriteLanguage cookie.

151
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,200
All right, so now that I have the cookie,

152
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,189
I know the actual value of the favoriteLanguage,

153
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:29,114
now what I can do down in this body here

154
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:32,429
is I can actually show a personalized page

155
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:35,146
based on this information,

156
00:07:35,146 --> 00:07:36,654
so that favLang, that's the variable

157
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:40,821
that we received a little higher up there on line 20.

158
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,527
So, I'm just going to set up

159
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:45,444
some little sections here for this.

160
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:49,531
So for example, showing new books for this language,

161
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:53,077
so I'll say hey, new books for language X

162
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:55,220
and so, I'll just drop in an expression here,

163
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,375
angle bracket percent with an equal symbol, favLang

164
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:59,830
and then I'll just set up a UL

165
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,966
for unorderedList

166
00:08:00,966 --> 00:08:03,014
and I'll just put in some placeholders here,

167
00:08:03,014 --> 00:08:05,558
blah, blah, blah, just placeholders,

168
00:08:05,558 --> 00:08:07,444
no real stuff there.

169
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,949
Ideally we could maybe talk to a database,

170
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,480
query a database, get a list of books

171
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,877
for this given topic

172
00:08:13,877 --> 00:08:15,021
and then print those out

173
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:17,749
but for now we'll just put in the little placeholders here.

174
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:21,832
We simply want to focus on cookies for right now.

175
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:24,833
So, now what I'll do is I'll take this information,

176
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,858
I'll just kind of do a copy, paste on it

177
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:28,279
and I'll just drop it in here,

178
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,388
so this is for latest news reports

179
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:32,804
for the favoriteLanguage

180
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,379
and then a similar thing here,

181
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,469
another copy, paste and I'll just drop in

182
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,145
hot jobs for favoriteLanguage and blah, blah, blah

183
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:41,978
and that's pretty much it.

184
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:44,529
So, we have a customized page

185
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,856
based on that cookie value

186
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:48,968
and we're showing it to the user,

187
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:51,718
so this looks pretty good so far.

188
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,062
And then one last thing I wanna do

189
00:08:54,062 --> 00:08:56,232
I simply want to give them a link

190
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,121
where they can personalize this page again,

191
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,137
so say for example they wanted to change the language

192
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:02,347
to like PHP or Ruby or C#,

193
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:06,014
they can easily do that with this href link.

194
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:10,267
All right, so I'm going to save this file,

195
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:14,440
and I can move over and now we should have three files

196
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,368
right now, so we should have our cookies-homepage,

197
00:09:17,368 --> 00:09:19,065
our personalize-form

198
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:22,434
and also our personalize-response.

199
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,500
So, let's go ahead and run the homepage right now,

200
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,442
so I'll simply do a right click

201
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:30,359
and I'll choose Run As, and then Run on Server.

202
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:35,082
And so, this will bring it up in the internal browser.

203
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:36,988
I want to just copy this URL.

204
00:09:36,988 --> 00:09:39,532
I'm gonna drop it into the Firefox browser,

205
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:40,865
so I'll say Copy

206
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:45,388
and I'll move over to Firefox,

207
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,528
I'll drop that in

208
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,068
and so, here's the actual page,

209
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:49,543
so training protal

210
00:09:49,543 --> 00:09:51,633
and then by default we're just showing Java

211
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,170
because no cookies were set at this time.

212
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,246
I can go ahead and click the link

213
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,894
to personalize the page

214
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:58,033
and I can go through and choose

215
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:59,520
one of the languages here

216
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,437
and in this example I'm gonna choose PHP

217
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:03,770
as the language.

218
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:11,196
And then I'll go ahead and hit the Submit button.

219
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,866
Okay, great, so it says hey, thanks,

220
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:15,490
we set your favorite language to PHP,

221
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,753
so behind the scenes they created a cookie

222
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:20,109
and they passed it back to the browser.

223
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:20,942
Now you can go ahead

224
00:10:20,942 --> 00:10:24,359
and click on this Return to Homepage link

225
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,252
and now note our customized page right now.

226
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:30,888
So, New Books for PHP,

227
00:10:30,888 --> 00:10:33,330
Reports, Hot Jobs and so on,

228
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,341
so our cookies portion of it is working out just fine for us

229
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:38,424
and this is kind of cool.

230
00:10:39,737 --> 00:10:41,010
But you may want to actually verify

231
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,686
that the cookies are actually being set,

232
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:44,124
so in the Firefox browser

233
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:47,229
you can just click on this option here to the far right,

234
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,979
move down and choose Preferences,

235
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:55,385
and over on the far left there's a little menu item here

236
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:58,802
called Privacy, we can select that option

237
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:02,948
and again, remember,

238
00:11:02,948 --> 00:11:05,936
here in the center, remove individual cookies.

239
00:11:05,936 --> 00:11:07,865
That's the link that will actually show us

240
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:09,448
all of the cookies.

241
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:14,605
And here are the cookies

242
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:17,640
that were set for our site, localhost

243
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,940
and we can kind of expand this a bit

244
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,977
and we'll see that there are two cookies sent,

245
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:25,137
JSESSIONID and there's myApp.favoriteLanguage,

246
00:11:25,137 --> 00:11:26,750
so I'll select that guy,

247
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,853
so that's the cookie name,

248
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,466
that's what we created in our code

249
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:30,395
and that's the content,

250
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:32,088
that's what the user just selected here

251
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:33,588
in that last demo.

252
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:38,830
So, this all looks really good.

253
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,009
This is kind of how we designed it

254
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:42,473
and how we actually implemented our code.

255
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:46,556
So, I would say congrats on doing cookies in JSP.
