00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:02,907
<v Instructor>Hello, in this video,</v>

2
00:00:02,907 --> 00:00:06,740
we're gonna learn how to use cookies with ASP.

3
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:11,045
So we'll cover the following topics.

4
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:13,010
First off we'll find out what are cookies

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,438
and how we can use them and then we'll actually

6
00:00:15,438 --> 00:00:18,821
explore the cookies API and learn how to write code

7
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:20,461
for reading and writing cookies.

8
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:21,637
Alright, so we have a lot of good things

9
00:00:21,637 --> 00:00:22,952
in store in this video.

10
00:00:22,952 --> 00:00:24,987
Let's go ahead and get started

11
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:26,708
so what's the purpose of cookies

12
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,514
and you may have heard of cookies before

13
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:30,672
but basically cookies allow you to personalize

14
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:33,247
a website for a user and so in effect

15
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:36,759
you can actually keep track of any user preferences.

16
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,060
Say for example you have a new site

17
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,863
and a user chose their favorite programming language

18
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,720
as Java, then you can keep track of that

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,192
and show them Java news in the future

20
00:00:45,192 --> 00:00:48,255
or if you have a travel site and they frequently fly

21
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,348
from a given airport, then you can show them

22
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:52,794
all flights from that given airport.

23
00:00:52,794 --> 00:00:55,571
So it allows you to keep track of long term preferences

24
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,372
for a user even after they close

25
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,789
their browser and restart it.

26
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:04,174
Alright so let's look at an example here

27
00:01:04,174 --> 00:01:07,282
so I'll use that expedia.com travel site.

28
00:01:07,282 --> 00:01:09,068
Again I use this website a lot

29
00:01:09,068 --> 00:01:13,018
because I travel frequently between Philadelphia and India

30
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,955
so here in this form I'll just go ahead

31
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:18,436
and setup my departure city of where I'm flying from,

32
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:22,887
Philadelphia, PA in the US and I travel to Bangalore

33
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:25,425
at the deal in India so I'll just set up

34
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:29,356
the departure dates, I'm just making this up right now.

35
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,824
My departure date and my return date

36
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:34,205
but the key here is that once I do a search,

37
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:36,121
Expedia will go off and find flights for me

38
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:38,012
from Philadelphia to Bangalore.

39
00:01:38,012 --> 00:01:40,352
Now the nice thing about it is that Expedia

40
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,735
will actually create a cookie and store it on my browser

41
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:45,911
such that when they come back at a later time

42
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:48,701
or actually when I come back at a later time,

43
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:50,831
Expedia will remember, it's like hey,

44
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,498
your last flight that you searched for

45
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:55,481
was Philadelphia to Bangalore and here's some new prices.

46
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:58,882
So I'll go ahead and quit my browser right now

47
00:01:58,882 --> 00:02:01,753
and then I'll start up the browser again from scratch

48
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:04,308
and so now I have my browser back up

49
00:02:04,308 --> 00:02:06,631
and then I actually go into Expedia again

50
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,672
and it'll actually remember information

51
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:11,736
about my previous operation and again,

52
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:12,937
they're making use of cookies,

53
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:14,804
they're keeping track of my preferences

54
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:16,424
so they automatically know that I'm gonna go

55
00:02:16,424 --> 00:02:18,908
from Philadelphia to Bangalore,

56
00:02:18,908 --> 00:02:21,601
just as a suggestion and they make use of cookies

57
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,681
for this type of functionality which is really cool

58
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:27,295
and I'll actually show you how to write Java code

59
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:31,462
or JSP code for reading cookies and also writing cookies.

60
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,701
Alright, so again what is a cookie?

61
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:37,816
Well it's basically text data that's exchanged

62
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:39,941
between the web browser and server

63
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:42,651
so this is functionality that's built into the browser

64
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:45,782
so you have your web browser when you visit a given server,

65
00:02:45,782 --> 00:02:49,949
that browser will send over cookies to that server

66
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,179
and so that's how that expedia.com website

67
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:54,691
was able to remember my information,

68
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,028
it says oh great, you've been to Expedia before.

69
00:02:57,028 --> 00:02:59,187
They read my cookies, they found out my departure

70
00:02:59,187 --> 00:03:03,815
and destination city and displayed a custom form for me.

71
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:06,396
The site can also create new cookies

72
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,862
and send them to my browser to keep track

73
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:12,148
of information for any of my return visits.

74
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,536
So that's the idea of a cookie and so I'll actually show you

75
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:17,593
the server side code for reading cookies

76
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:20,111
and also writing cookies and sending them back

77
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,361
to the browser.

78
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,073
Now what exactly is in a cookie?

79
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,419
Well you can kind of think of a cookie

80
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,304
as just like a name, value pair so a cookie has a given name

81
00:03:30,304 --> 00:03:33,611
like in this example, myApp.favoriteLanguage

82
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,825
and then the value could be Ruby,

83
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:37,783
alright so that's one cookie

84
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:39,852
and the application can actually make use

85
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,731
of multiple cookies so we can have another cookie here

86
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:47,429
called myApp.favoriteCity and then the value

87
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:50,504
could be Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

88
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:53,978
and your application can actually create many cookies,

89
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:57,728
the max is about 20 cookies per site per path

90
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:01,216
but that's more than enough for most examples

91
00:04:01,216 --> 00:04:03,383
for building applications.

92
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,025
Now how are cookies passed back and forth?

93
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,742
Well the browser when it connects to the server,

94
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:11,633
the browser will only send cookies

95
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:14,247
that match that server's domain alright

96
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:17,399
so here's our browser, we're connecting to a given website,

97
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,680
the browser will only send over cookies that match

98
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,375
so for example, when I connect to expedia.com,

99
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:27,754
it will only send over cookies from expedia.com.

100
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:31,813
Likewise, if I was using like maybe CNN.com

101
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:34,912
and connected to CNN, the browser would only send cookies

102
00:04:34,912 --> 00:04:38,842
that were set by CNN.com so they won't switch up

103
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:41,714
and send everything across like if I'm at Expedia,

104
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:45,058
it wouldn't send over CNN.com cookies to Expedia,

105
00:04:45,058 --> 00:04:47,277
only matches on the actual domain name

106
00:04:47,277 --> 00:04:50,449
and the given path of the application

107
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,357
so that's the key there so you know,

108
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:56,357
there's no security issues going on or whatever.

109
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,696
Alright so where are the cookies?

110
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:01,775
So I'm kinda moving back into my browser.

111
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,490
Depending on the browser you're using,

112
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,489
there's a different format for doing this

113
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:09,572
but here with Firefox, I can go under preferences

114
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,759
and once I'm on the preferences,

115
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,172
then over on the far left there's

116
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:20,255
a little menu option here for privacy

117
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:23,387
and I can select that link for privacy.

118
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:26,078
Now it's not really straightforward

119
00:05:26,078 --> 00:05:27,572
but there's a little link here

120
00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:29,339
called remove individual cookies.

121
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:31,959
This will allow you to view your cookies

122
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,448
so you can go ahead and select that link

123
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:35,469
and it'll show you a list of all cookies

124
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,980
that are set in this browser for the given domain names

125
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,433
so note here, you see all the sites,

126
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,262
the different sites that set cookies

127
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:45,099
and then the actual cookie name.

128
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:47,702
What I'm doing here is I'm actually searching for cookies

129
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:50,259
that were set by Expedia so we'll see all

130
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:52,639
these different Expedia sites

131
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,912
and the appropriate cookie names.

132
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,803
If you select one of these cookies,

133
00:05:56,803 --> 00:06:00,239
then it'll actually show you the name of the cookie,

134
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:03,400
the actual content, whatever text that's stored there,

135
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,433
the host and the path.

136
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:10,407
Also at the bottom you'll see there's a expiration tab.

137
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:13,180
I'm sorry, an expiration field so this will tell you

138
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,811
how long this cookie will last

139
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:17,561
so basically one year from today,

140
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:23,260
one year from today is when that cookie will expire

141
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,535
so it'll always be on my system

142
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,927
until that given timeframe comes up

143
00:06:27,927 --> 00:06:30,467
and I'll show you how to actually write the Java code

144
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:33,009
for setting the expiration time for cookies and so on

145
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,176
but anyway, just a nice little behind the scenes tour.

146
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:40,298
Alright so the cookie API.

147
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:43,207
Well there's a special class called cookie,

148
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:47,520
it's defined in the package javax.servlet.http.

149
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,710
This package is given to you for free in all JSP pages

150
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,011
so there's no hard requirement for you

151
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,655
to import this package.

152
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,205
You automatically get this package

153
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:59,846
so you can simply make use of the cookie class directly

154
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,263
in your JSP page.

155
00:07:03,196 --> 00:07:05,392
Now when you use a cookie, the first thing you need to do

156
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:08,155
is construct it alright so here's the actual constructor

157
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:11,606
from the Java documentation so you create a cookie,

158
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:14,310
you pass in the name of the cookie and the value

159
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,401
for the cookie.

160
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,117
Now the name you can give any name that you want

161
00:07:18,117 --> 00:07:20,355
as long as you're consistent within your application

162
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:23,554
and the value you can store any value or any data

163
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:27,387
that you want in the cookie as a string value.

164
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,990
Alright, so here's some real Java code

165
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,925
and you're probably wondering hey, where's the code.

166
00:07:32,925 --> 00:07:34,979
Alright so here's the code that we'll use

167
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,920
for actually sending a cookie to a browser okay,

168
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,595
so let me set this up so let's say for example,

169
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:43,189
there's a form, the user can select

170
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:45,154
their favorite programming language

171
00:07:45,154 --> 00:07:47,638
and they can send it over to this JSP page.

172
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,879
What this JSP page is gonna do is it's gonna read

173
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,507
that form data for their favorite programming language,

174
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:55,794
it's gonna create a cookie and it's gonna send it back

175
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:58,372
to the browser such that later on

176
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:01,011
when they come back to visit our site

177
00:08:01,011 --> 00:08:03,260
a day later, a week later or a month later,

178
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,995
we'll remember their favorite language

179
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:08,591
and then we can customize the output page

180
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:10,689
for their favorite programming language.

181
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,554
Alright, so let's kind of walk through the code here

182
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:13,635
so the first one here,

183
00:08:13,635 --> 00:08:15,775
request.getParameter("favoriteLanguage"),

184
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:18,542
again we're just reading something from the form data.

185
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,362
The next thing we need to do is create the cookie

186
00:08:20,362 --> 00:08:23,738
so I say new cookie, I give the name value pair

187
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:26,129
so the name is myApp.favoriteLanguage

188
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:29,367
and again the name can be anything, comma favLang,

189
00:08:29,367 --> 00:08:31,094
that's the variable from the previous line

190
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,550
so that's our cookie object.

191
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,312
Now we need to set the actual lifespan for the cookie,

192
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:37,577
how long do we want this cookie to last

193
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:41,546
so by default, a cookie has a lifespan of zero

194
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:44,464
which means that once the browser closes,

195
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:46,373
that cookie will expire.

196
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:48,209
So if you want the cookie to last for a longer time,

197
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,081
you have to set the lifespan

198
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:53,286
so here you have to say theCookie.setMaxAge

199
00:08:53,286 --> 00:08:54,984
and you give the age.

200
00:08:54,984 --> 00:08:57,864
Now this is the one part of the API

201
00:08:57,864 --> 00:09:00,345
that I just don't like.

202
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:01,759
I wish they could make something easy

203
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,540
like setting a duration, you could say one month,

204
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,104
two years or you know five years or something

205
00:09:08,104 --> 00:09:11,066
but you can't do that, it's not that simple.

206
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,064
You have to set the maximum age

207
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,647
as the total number of seconds.

208
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:19,052
Gosh I hate that.

209
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:20,872
Alright so anyway, so the bottom line

210
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:22,420
is that you have to do the math right

211
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,544
so if you want it for one week,

212
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:26,470
you have to compute the total number of seconds in a week.

213
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,418
If you want it for a year, the total number of seconds

214
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:31,315
in a year so this example here is for a year

215
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:33,931
so that's the total number of seconds for a year

216
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:38,030
and that's the API and that's just how it is.

217
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:39,674
But anyway, let's get that past that.

218
00:09:39,674 --> 00:09:40,794
Once we have the cookie created,

219
00:09:40,794 --> 00:09:44,148
we set the max age then we send the cookie to the browser

220
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:46,308
so we load it up into that response object

221
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:48,043
that's gonna go back to the browser

222
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:51,111
so here I say response.addCookie and I simply

223
00:09:51,111 --> 00:09:53,830
give a reference to the cookie variable

224
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,392
and that's it basically so that's

225
00:09:55,392 --> 00:09:56,811
for sending back one cookie.

226
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:59,406
If you wanted to send back multiple cookies,

227
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,225
well you simply create a new cookie object

228
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,918
and you say response.addCookie,

229
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:05,580
you know my cookie number two or whatever

230
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,370
and you repeat that process X number of times

231
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,236
but again there's a max on 20 cookies per domain per path

232
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,616
but anyway that's the basic code there

233
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,449
for sending a cookie to a browser.

234
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:20,604
Alright, so now the browser has a cookie

235
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:22,381
that's been set by our application

236
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,857
by our JSP from that previous slide.

237
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,905
Now when the user returns back at a later time,

238
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:30,008
we want to show them a custom page

239
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:32,089
based on their cookie information

240
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,847
so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna read

241
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:35,901
their favorite programming language cookie

242
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,973
and then do something with it.

243
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:41,050
So to get a handle to the cookies,

244
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,049
I make use of that request object

245
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:45,582
and I'll say request.getCookies.

246
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:48,871
This will return me an array of cookies

247
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:50,315
so note here on the left hand side,

248
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,726
cookie with the square bracket,

249
00:10:51,726 --> 00:10:55,305
the square brackets means an array so that's the cookies.

250
00:10:55,305 --> 00:10:56,936
Then I check to make sure theCookies

251
00:10:56,936 --> 00:10:58,528
is not equal to null because maybe

252
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:00,352
they didn't have any to send over.

253
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:01,777
Once I know we have cookies,

254
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:03,530
then I simply do a for loop

255
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:07,958
so I set up a for loop, Cookie tempCookie : theCookies

256
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,576
and the cookies is the variable from that previous line

257
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:13,263
so then I simply go through each one of those cookies

258
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:16,171
and I compare that cookie name to the name

259
00:11:16,171 --> 00:11:18,089
that I'm looking for so I'm actually looking

260
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,848
for the cookie name, myApp.favoriteLanguage

261
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,514
so I simply say if myApp.favoriteLanguage

262
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:27,229
equals tempCookie.getName,

263
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,527
then that's the favorite language

264
00:11:29,527 --> 00:11:32,551
equals tempCookie.Value so I get the value of that cookie

265
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,867
and then I break out of that loop

266
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,345
and then later on in my JSP page,

267
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,443
I could maybe use that fave language

268
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:40,384
to display custom news for the user

269
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:42,109
like maybe I would hit the database

270
00:11:42,109 --> 00:11:45,854
and get some information or hit a Twitter feed or something

271
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:47,466
but at that point, I have the key,

272
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:50,179
I have the actual value of the favorite cookie

273
00:11:50,179 --> 00:11:52,238
that the user selected and I can do

274
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:54,676
whatever I'd like to do it so in a nutshell,

275
00:11:54,676 --> 00:11:58,209
that's how you read cookies from the browser.

276
00:11:58,209 --> 00:11:59,934
Now again this is kind of very high level,

277
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:02,126
we just saw some code snippets.

278
00:12:02,126 --> 00:12:05,471
In the next video, we'll write some real code

279
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,451
and I'll pull together a nice little example

280
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:09,709
where we'll have some JSP pages,

281
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,706
we're reading cookies, we're setting cookies

282
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:13,231
and we're building custom pages

283
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:16,349
so don't worry, I'll put this altogether for you

284
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,997
and you'll see a nice working example, alright.

285
00:12:18,997 --> 00:12:20,875
So I'll see you in the next video.
