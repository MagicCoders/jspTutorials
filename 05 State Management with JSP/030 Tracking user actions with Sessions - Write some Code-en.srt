1
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:02,250
<v Instructor>Hey, in this video</v>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,058
I'm gonna show you how to do session tracking with JSP

3
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:08,592
and in particular we'll cover the coding portion of it.

4
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,466
Now, just as a quick refresher

5
00:00:10,466 --> 00:00:12,714
let's look at the app that we're gonna code,

6
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,579
so again, remember, the demo,

7
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:16,202
you can add a new item

8
00:00:16,202 --> 00:00:20,035
and we'll display the list here at the bottom.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,716
So, I can type in a new item like buy groceries,

10
00:00:23,716 --> 00:00:25,122
click on the Submit button

11
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:27,797
and it'll show up there at the bottom in my to-do list

12
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:29,424
and I can add one more item here,

13
00:00:29,424 --> 00:00:31,192
go to gym and again.

14
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:33,890
Now, remember, the to-do list is actually saved

15
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,298
in our session object,

16
00:00:35,298 --> 00:00:36,891
so it's a unique object

17
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:40,818
for each browser or user of our application

18
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:42,224
and I'll actually show you how to write

19
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:46,391
all of the coding for this from scratch in this video.

20
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:54,214
You know how I love to-do lists,

21
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:55,482
so here, the first thing we need to do

22
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:57,712
is create the HTML form,

23
00:00:57,712 --> 00:00:58,924
then the second thing we need to do

24
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:01,637
is add the new item to the to-do list

25
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:04,482
and then finally, we need to display all to-do items

26
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:06,453
from the session object.

27
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:08,085
All right, so a lot of good stuff here

28
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:09,158
and we'll actually write all the code

29
00:01:09,158 --> 00:01:10,991
for this from scratch.

30
00:01:15,699 --> 00:01:17,585 line:15% 
All right, so just moving into Eclipse,

31
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:20,079 line:15% 
the first thing we need to do is create a new file,

32
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,452
so in our WebContent folder

33
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:22,535
we'll just do a right click,

34
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:24,202
we'll say New, File.

35
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,969
And I'll give the name of this file here,

36
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:31,636
I'll call it to do list demo.jsp

37
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:36,378
and once I'm happy with the name

38
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,664
I'll click on the Finish button.

39
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,504
All right, so we have our empty page here.

40
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:45,337
We'll start off with our normal HTML body tags

41
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,268
and now what I wanna do is just write out some comments

42
00:01:55,268 --> 00:01:58,091
as far as our major steps in our to-do list,

43
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:02,006
so step one we need to create the HTML form

44
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,526
and then in step two we need to add

45
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:06,231
the new item to the to-do list

46
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,726
and then for step three we need to display

47
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:10,268
all to-do items from the session,

48
00:02:10,268 --> 00:02:12,238
so this is our basic game plan here

49
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:13,413
for building out the code

50
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,074
and again, we'll write all the code for this from scratch

51
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:17,241
in this video.

52
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:21,932
All right, so let's start with step one,

53
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:23,205
creating the HTML form,

54
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:26,358
so the first thing we need to do is set up the form.

55
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:29,369
We'll set the action equals todo-demo.jsp,

56
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:32,036
so basically this page will submit data

57
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:34,131
right back to itself

58
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:36,858
because our file is called todo-demo.jsp,

59
00:02:36,858 --> 00:02:39,066
so we're going to submit data right back to ourself

60
00:02:39,066 --> 00:02:41,874
and I'll show you how to handle reading a form data

61
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:44,640
but what I'll do here is I'll set up this input text

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,759
for the items.

63
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,948
That's where the user will enter their to-do item

64
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:53,115
and I'll also set up another input type here for submit.

65
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:58,414
So, this is for the actual submit button.

66
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:02,907
And that's it, that's our basic HTML form

67
00:03:02,907 --> 00:03:06,193
for reading in a to-do list item

68
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:08,443
along with a submit button.

69
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,827
And then just as a basic test harness here

70
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,100
I simply want to display that form data

71
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,866
just to verify that I can actually read the data

72
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,973
that they passed in,

73
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:22,806
so here I'll just say item entered

74
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,199
and then I'll say request.getParameter theItem,

75
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,911
so that will actually read the form data

76
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:31,153
and that's the same name as the field up here

77
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,593
on line seven as far as the name,

78
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:36,132 line:15% 
so we're basically reading that form field

79
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,007 line:15% 
and printing the information out.

80
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:39,558 line:15% 
Now, the first time we show this page

81
00:03:39,558 --> 00:03:41,150 line:15% 
that value will be null

82
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,673 line:15% 
but we'll fill it in with some real information

83
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:44,600 line:15% 
as we submit data.

84
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,505
All right, so let's run it,

85
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:46,626
let's just right click on that file,

86
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:49,043
say Run As and Run on Server.

87
00:03:54,633 --> 00:03:57,168
All right, so again, here's our form here.

88
00:03:57,168 --> 00:03:58,882
Notice the item entered is null

89
00:03:58,882 --> 00:03:59,986
but once I submit data,

90
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:02,437
then we see that new form field show up,

91
00:04:02,437 --> 00:04:04,213
so I'll go to the store,

92
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:06,773
do the laundry and so on,

93
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:09,243
so we know that our form's working properly

94
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:12,052
and we know that our JSP can display that form data,

95
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,802
so this looks really good so far.

96
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,716
All right, so let's move down to step number two

97
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,988
and here we need to actually add the new item

98
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:21,488
to the to-do list.

99
00:04:23,511 --> 00:04:24,815
So, one thing we're gonna make use of

100
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:27,259
is we're gonna make use of collections,

101
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,688
I want to make use of an array list.

102
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,767
We'll say get the to-do items from the session.

103
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,131
If the item doesn't exist,

104
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:38,645
then we're actually gonna create a new one

105
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,353
and we'll also see if there's any form data

106
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:42,270
that needs to be added.

107
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:45,677
So, that's our basic game plan here

108
00:04:45,677 --> 00:04:47,344
for step number two.

109
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,138
All right, so one thing we're gonna need to use

110
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:56,789
is a lot of classes from the java.util package,

111
00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:58,318
so let me just move to the top of this file

112
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:02,037
and just do an import on the package java.util,

113
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:04,187
so again, we do the angle bracket percent

114
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:05,757
with an at symbol

115
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:09,174
and we say page import equals java.util.*

116
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,526
so this will give me everything in the java.util package

117
00:05:12,526 --> 00:05:15,383
like list, array list, so on and so forth

118
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:18,009
and we use that a lot in this JSP page,

119
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:19,957
so the import here will help us out

120
00:05:19,957 --> 00:05:22,790
and save us on some of the typing.

121
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,286
The first thing I need to do here

122
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,808
is get the items from the sessions,

123
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,248
so I'll say List&lt;String&gt; items

124
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:35,350
equals LIst&lt;String&gt; for down casting it,

125
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:38,988
so we're gonna have a list of type string

126
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:41,801
and we say session.getAttribute

127
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,894
and we give the name

128
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:45,031
and here again, we can give any name

129
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:46,194
as long as we're consistent,

130
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:49,527
so for the name I'll call it myToDoList.

131
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,058
So, this will use that built-in session object

132
00:05:54,058 --> 00:05:57,110
say getAttribute for a given name myToDoList

133
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,674
and down cast it accordingly.

134
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:00,777
Now, first I need to make sure

135
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,207
that it exists or not,

136
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:04,674
so if it doesn't exist, then I need to create a new one,

137
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:06,521
so if items equals null,

138
00:06:06,521 --> 00:06:08,517
then that means I need to create a new list,

139
00:06:08,517 --> 00:06:12,531
so here I say items equals new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;

140
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:14,321
so this will basically give me an array list

141
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:17,231
that can hold string items

142
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,320
and now I'm gonna actually add this list

143
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,843
to the session, so I'll say session.setAttribute

144
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:24,033
and then I give the name

145
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,020
and again, I'm going to use the same name

146
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,751
that I used for retrieving it, myToDoList

147
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:32,751 line:15% 
and I simply say setAttribute myToDoList, items.

148
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,374 line:15% 
And so, this handles making sure

149
00:06:37,374 --> 00:06:40,073 line:15% 
that we have an item in the session,

150
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:42,475 line:15% 
if not, we create a new one

151
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:45,892 line:15% 
and then we set that list on the session.

152
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:51,516
Now, the next thing we need to do

153
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,342
is see if there's form data to add,

154
00:06:53,342 --> 00:06:57,660
so I just use that method request.getParameter

155
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:00,993
and I use the parameter name of theItem,

156
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:05,808
so that's the actual form field that we had earlier

157
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:07,152
in this exercise.

158
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:10,940
Then I simply say if theItem is not equal to null

159
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,353
and that means that we have some data

160
00:07:12,353 --> 00:07:14,359
and we can actually add that data,

161
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,410
so I'm gonna add this data to the list

162
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,663
of items, so here we say items.add

163
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:21,621
and we pass in theItem

164
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,955
and again, remember, items is the arrayList

165
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:26,357
and theItem is the actual form data

166
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:28,460
that we read in, so we're basically just adding

167
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,728
something to that existing list

168
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:33,271
and it'll simply build over time.

169
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:36,072
And remember, the arrayList is more like a global array.

170
00:07:36,072 --> 00:07:39,405
You can simply add multiple items to it.

171
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,136
All right, so we're almost there.

172
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:46,084
The final step here, step three,

173
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:48,330
display all to-do items from the session.

174
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,382
So first off, let me just give you some basic HTML markup,

175
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:54,852
just like a little header here, To Do List Items,

176
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,059
all that good stuff, put a break there

177
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:01,157 line:15% 
and now what I need to do is build a bullet list of items,

178
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:02,694 line:15% 
so here I make use of ol,

179
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:05,111 line:15% 
it's HTML tag for orderedList

180
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,974 line:15% 
and this will basically give us a numbered list basically

181
00:08:09,974 --> 00:08:11,663 line:15% 
and now I'll add a scriptlet

182
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:14,020 line:15% 
and I'm gonna loop through that arrayList

183
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,779 line:15% 
and then for each item simply print it out.

184
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:19,395 line:15% 
So, here I say string temp : items,

185
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,621 line:15% 
that's our list

186
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,408 line:15% 
and then I do an out.printLine

187
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:24,077 line:15% 
which is another built-in object

188
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:27,953 line:15% 
that we can use for printing directly to that JSP page.

189
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:31,657 line:15% 
So, here I'll say out.printLine, li temp

190
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:33,289 line:15% 
plus slash li,

191
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:35,534 line:15% 
so li is for listItem,

192
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,085 line:15% 
so this will basically help us build

193
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,970 line:15% 
a numbered list or an ordered list

194
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,220 line:15% 
of items for the HTML page.

195
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,592 line:15% 
We'll do this dynamically on the fly

196
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:48,759 line:15% 
based on whatever's in the to-do list.

197
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:56,596
All right, so this looks really good so far,

198
00:08:56,596 --> 00:08:59,429
so I think we're pretty much done.

199
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,565
Oh yeah, just some clean up here on lines 14 and 15,

200
00:09:03,565 --> 00:09:05,667
remove that code, we don't need this anymore,

201
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,289
that was more of just a test,

202
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,859
so I just rip that out, I'll delete that code

203
00:09:10,859 --> 00:09:12,192
and save my file

204
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,693
and now we can move back to the browser.

205
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:16,983
The only thing I need to do is just remove those parameters

206
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:18,221
from the end of this URL,

207
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:20,330
so everything after the question mark

208
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,436
I can simply highlight and hit the delete key on

209
00:09:23,436 --> 00:09:24,440
and I'll just hit enter,

210
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,890
it'll refresh the page.

211
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:26,844
All right, so at this point,

212
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:29,537
add new item, my to-do list items is null

213
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:30,860
or empty actually,

214
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,943
I'll add a new item here,

215
00:09:34,428 --> 00:09:36,300
mow the yard, hit Submit,

216
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,446
so it's adding it to our to-do list,

217
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,446
wash the dishes, Submit,

218
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,813
and record more Java videos, come on, buddy,

219
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:48,314
get on the stick.

220
00:09:48,314 --> 00:09:50,755
So, I need to record more videos.

221
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:52,711
I also need to write a lot of code,

222
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:53,912
so let me just add this in here,

223
00:09:53,912 --> 00:09:56,981
so I crank out some more code.

224
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:59,885
That's what this is all about.

225
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:00,736
And so, that's it, so notice here

226
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:02,011
how we're building a list,

227
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:03,527
it's keeping track of everything

228
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:06,167
and it works out pretty good

229
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:07,832
and hopefully at the end of tonight

230
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:09,474
I can actually get some sleep.

231
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:10,312
We'll see.

232
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:12,712
But again, we're making use of session tracking,

233
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,156
we're keeping track of all of our to-do items

234
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,374
in the session, so these items are unique

235
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:20,006
for this given browser user.

236
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:21,388
If I opened up a different browser,

237
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,522
I'd see a totally different list,

238
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,993
that will be empty

239
00:10:23,993 --> 00:10:25,627
and we can basically keep track

240
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,189
of all the unique actions for a given user,

241
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:31,357
so that's kind of session tracking in a nutshell.

242
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:32,190
Good job.
