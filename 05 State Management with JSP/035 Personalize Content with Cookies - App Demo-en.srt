1
00:00:01,165 --> 00:00:02,951
<v Chad>Hey, in this video we're actually</v>

2
00:00:02,951 --> 00:00:04,541
gonna look at the code demo

3
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:06,791
for using cookies with JSP.

4
00:00:08,814 --> 00:00:10,213
So, lets kind of pull it all together

5
00:00:10,213 --> 00:00:11,708
with a real example.

6
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,027
So, we're gonna have three pages

7
00:00:13,027 --> 00:00:14,957
that we're gonna build in this video.

8
00:00:14,957 --> 00:00:16,349
The first thing we're gonna start off with

9
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,739
is the cookies homepage,

10
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:20,048
so this is for our little training portal,

11
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,948
so if the user has a favorite language selected,

12
00:00:22,948 --> 00:00:25,651
then we'll show them a list of new books on that topic,

13
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,411
news reports, and hot jobs, and so on.

14
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:31,530
So, by default, if they don't have any cookies set,

15
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,639
we'll simply just make use of Java

16
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:35,319
as their default language.

17
00:00:35,319 --> 00:00:36,757
Now, at the bottom they have a link

18
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:39,155
where they can actually personalize this page

19
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:40,663
and choose a different language.

20
00:00:40,663 --> 00:00:42,978
So, this will take us over to our cookies form

21
00:00:42,978 --> 00:00:45,322
where they can select their own programming language,

22
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:46,996
or their favorite programming language,

23
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:50,376
and here Java, C Sharp, PHP, Ruby,

24
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:51,940
they can select that favorite language,

25
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,321
Like, say for example they chose Ruby,

26
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,214
they hit submit,

27
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:56,682
then at the bottom,

28
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,843
we'll give them their response page

29
00:00:58,843 --> 00:01:00,159
or confirmation page saying,

30
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,192
hey, thanks, we've set your favorite language to Ruby.

31
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,778
Now, when they return back to the homepage,

32
00:01:05,778 --> 00:01:07,508
then new versions of the homepage

33
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:09,278
will make use of the cookie that was set

34
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,211
and then show that information accordingly.

35
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:14,999
So, let's look at a real quick demo here.

36
00:01:14,999 --> 00:01:16,296
Starting at the homepage,

37
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:18,494
by default the language is Java,

38
00:01:18,494 --> 00:01:20,882
so we're assuming that no cookies were set

39
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:23,799
and we just simply default to Java.

40
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:29,007
Now the user can go through and personalize this page.

41
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,799
So, here there's a form,

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,495
they can choose a drop down list,

43
00:01:32,495 --> 00:01:35,044
choose their favorite programming language.

44
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:39,090
So, in this example here I'll choose Ruby,

45
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,090
and then I'll hit the submit button.

46
00:01:43,785 --> 00:01:45,552
And so again, the confirmation page,

47
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:47,567
hey, we set your favorite language to Ruby.

48
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:50,716
Now, when I return back to the homepage,

49
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:54,883
it should personalize it for the Ruby language for me.

50
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:58,235
So, here selecting return to homepage

51
00:01:58,235 --> 00:01:59,190
and then here it is,

52
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,996
new books for Ruby.

53
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:02,219
Latest news reports for Ruby.

54
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,370
Hot jobs for Ruby.

55
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,381
So, basically what this page is doing now

56
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,655
is it's simply reading the cookie value

57
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:09,267
and reading that favorite language

58
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,971
and then it's customizing this page

59
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,592
based on that cookie.

60
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:15,947
Now, remember, cookies last for a long time,

61
00:02:15,947 --> 00:02:17,985
so I can actually close my browser

62
00:02:17,985 --> 00:02:19,376
and then come back in

63
00:02:19,376 --> 00:02:20,894
and it'll actually remember

64
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:22,902
that cookie information for me.

65
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:24,913
So, cookies are persistent

66
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,328
based on the actual age you set for the cookie

67
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:29,444
and it'll last for that given time period.

68
00:02:29,444 --> 00:02:32,199
So, we see this works out for us in this example.

69
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:33,866
So, good job so far.

70
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,593
All right, so let's talk about writing code,

71
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:40,083
but I always like to start with a to do list.

72
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:41,302
The first thing we're gonna have to do

73
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:44,364
is create an HTML form to personalize the site.

74
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,678
Then, we'll need to build a JSP to read form data

75
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,209
and set cookies.

76
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,212
And then finally, we have to create our home page

77
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:56,480
to read the cookies and display the personalized content.

78
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,593
A lot of good things in store here.

79
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:02,093
Let's dive in and start writin' some code.
